```
Bob:      Hi, Jessica.
          Thanks for joining me for your performance review.
          I want to start by saying that you've done a great job with your QA work.
          You've caught several issues, which has really helped the team.
Jessica:  Thank you, Bob. I'm glad to hear that.
Bob:      However, I've noticed that your documentation isn't always complete.
          If the documentation isn't detailed enough,
          it can cause problems later.
          What do you think?
Jessica:  I understand.
          I've been focusing more on the testing,
          but I see how better documentation could help the team.
          I'll work on it.
Bob:      Sounds good.
          If we improve the documentation,
          it will be easier for others to follow your work.
          If you need any support with this, let me know.
Jessica:  Thanks, Bob.
          I'll start making changes right away.
Bob:      Great.
          Overall, I think you're doing a fantastic job.
          Let's set some goals for the next quarter to ensure you're on track.
          If you need help, just ask.
Jessica:  That sounds like a plan.
          I appreciate your feedback.
          I'll work on improving the documentation and continue to focus on quality.
Bob:      Excellent.
          Let's have a great quarter ahead.
          Talk to you soon, Jessica.
Jessica:  Thanks, Bob.
           Talk to you soon.
