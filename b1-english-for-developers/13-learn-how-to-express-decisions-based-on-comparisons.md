```
Sophie: Hey Jake,
        I'm looking at two software tools for our next project.
        Can you help me decide which one is better for security?
Jake:   Sure Sophie, what are the options?
Sophie: The first one is SecureSoft and the other is Safeguard.
        SecureSoft seems more user-friendly,
        but I'm not sure about its security features.
Jake:   I know SecureSoft.
        It's a bit easier to use,
        but I think Safeguard is more robust when it comes to security.
        It has stronger encryption and better protection against vulnerabilities.
Sophie: That makes sense.
        SecureSoft does have a nicer interface,
        but if Safeguard is more secure,
        it's probably the better choice.
        What about performance?
        Which one is faster?
Jake:   From my experience,
        Safeguard is slightly faster.
        It has more efficient processing,
        so it doesn't slow down the system as much.
        SecureSoft is good,
        but it can be a bit sluggish when handling large datasets.
Sophie: Thanks for pointing that out.
        I noticed that SecureSoft has more integration options with other tools.
        Is Safeguard as flexible?
Jake:   Not really.
        Safeguard is more focused on security,
        so it might not integrate as easily with other platforms.
        If integration is crucial,
        you might have to do some extra work with Safeguard.
Sophie: That's good to know.
        I think I'll go with Safeguard since security is our top priority,
        but I'll keep in mind the integration challenges.
        Thanks for your help, Jake.
Jake:   No problem, Sophie.
        If you have any other questions, just let me know.

### Comparatices

In comparative form:

- **adjectives or adverbs with one syllable usually add -er (like stronger and faster) in the end**. Remember when ends whit "-Y", change for "-i", like easy -> easier. For example:

| adjectives or adverbs  | comparative |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| nice | nicer |
| strong | stronger |
| easy | easier |
| fast | faster |

- **longer adjectives or adverbs use more**, **more** is a comparative term used to indicate a greater amount, quantity, degree, or number of something in relation to another. For example

| adjectives or adverbs  | comparative |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| interesting  | more interesting |
| efficiently | more efficiently |
| user-friendly | more user-friendly |
| robust | more robust |
| secure | more secure |
  
- **some words have irregular comparative form**. For example:

| adjectives or adverbs  | comparative |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| good | better |
