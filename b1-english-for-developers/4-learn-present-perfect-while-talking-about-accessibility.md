```
Tom:    Hey, Sophie, have you been working on the screen reader updates recently?
Sophie: Yes, I started a few months ago.
        We've been addressing the feedback from our last user survey.
        How's the design side coming along?
Tom:    Pretty well, actually.
        I've been tweaking the layouts based on the guidelines you shared.
Sophie: That's good to hear.
        Do you think the users have noticed the improvements?
Tom:    I think so.
        We haven't been receiving as many negative comments.
Sophie: That's a relief.
        How long do you think we'll need to keep making adjustments?
Tom:    Probably a few more weeks.
        We've been making steady progress,
        and I believe we're close to finalizing the major changes.
Sophie: That's good news. It feels great to make our app more accessible.

### Present Perfect Continuous

The Present Perfect Continuous tense is used **to describe actions that started in the past and are still happening**. 

-**It focuses on the duration or continuation of the action.** 

The structure of this tense is_ **have/has + been + verb(-ing)**. 

For example:

`We have been developing a new app for accessibility`. -> This means the development started in the past and is still ongoing.

`He has been fixing bugs in the software for several hours`. -> This means he started fixing the bugs earlier and is still working on it.

### Present Perfect Continuous - Question form

The interrogative form of the Present Perfect Continuous is created by using **Have/Has + subject + been + verb(-ing)**. 

It is used to ask about actions that started in the past and are still happening. 

For example: `Have they been testing the new software features?` -> Someone checks if the testing has been ongoing.

### Present Perfect Continuous - Negative

**Haven't** is the contraction of **have not**, used in the Present Perfect tense to indicate that an action has not occurred.

Negative refers to something unfavorable or critical. 

For example: `The user left a negative review about the app's performance.` -> Here, negative describes the unfavorable nature of the review.

```
Alice: James, have you heard about the closed captioning issue on our video platform?
Kames: Yes, for some reason it hasn't been displaying correctly for some users.
       The captions are misaligned and out of sync, which isn't good for accessibility.
Alice: Exactly.
       Do you know if it's been affecting all the videos or just a few?
James: It seems to be affecting several videos.
       Our quality assurance team has been testing the platform
       and noticed that the captions aren't syncing properly.
Alice: That's concerning.
       Have they found out why it's happening?
James: Not yet.
       The synchronization code hasn't been updated in a while,
       which might be part of the problem.
       Also, the captions haven't been rendering consistently across different devices.
Alice: Is there a plan to fix it?
James: We're working on it.
       The development team hasn't found a definitive solution yet,
       but they're narrowing down the possibilities.

```
Bob:   Hi Linda have you been working on the new voice command features?
Linda: Yes, I've been testing them since the latest software update.
       We've had some positive feedback, but there are still a few bugs to fix.
Bob:   How long have you been focusing on this evaluation?
Linda: For the past couple weeks.
       I've been trying to cover all scenarios to ensure that the commands work consistently.
Bob:   Have you had any problems with voice recognition?
Linda: A few.
       The system hasn't been responding well to certain accents,
       and it struggles with background noise.
       We need to improve its accuracy.
Bob:   What about the integration with other systems?
       Has it been seamless?
Linda: Not entirely.
       It's had issues connecting with our older devices,
       but we're working on it.
       The development team has been brainstorming solutions.
Bob:   That's a good start.
       By the way, have we tested it with real users yet?
Linda: Not yet, but we plan to.
       I think it would be helpful to get some real-world feedback before we roll it out completely.
```

### Present Perfect Continuous - for

In the Present Perfect Continuous tense, for is used to specify the duration of time that an action has been happening. For example:

I have been studying for my exams for three hours. - In this sentence, for indicates the length of time (three hours) that the action of studying has been taking place.

- **for vs. since**: For is used with periods of time (e.g., days, weeks), while since is used with specific dates or points in time.

```
Anna:  Hi, James.
       Have you been reviewing the training feedback for our accessibility program?
James: Yes, I've been working on it since the last training session.
       We've received a lot of positive comments,
       but there are some areas we still need to improve.                  
Anna:  That's great to hear.
       How long have we been running these sessions?
James: We've been conducting them for about six months now.
       It's been a gradual process,
       but we've seen steady progress in our team's understanding of accessibility.
Anna:  Are there any specific areas where people haven't been performing as expected?
James: Yes, the interactive activities haven't been as effective as we thought.
       It seems that some of the scenarios weren't relevant enough for the participants.
Anna:  I see.
       Have you identified any solutions to make them more engaging?
James: We're working on it.
       The instructional design team has been brainstorming ideas to make the sessions more interactive.
       We've also considered incorporating more real-life scenarios.
Anna:  That makes sense.
       Let's keep in touch to monitor the progress and ensure we're meeting our accessibility goals.
