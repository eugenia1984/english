## Dialogue 1: Improving Screen Reader Compatibility

```
Tom:    Hey, Sophie, have you been working on the screen reader updates recently?
Sophie: Yes, I started a few months ago.
        We've been addressing the feedback from our last user survey.
        How's the design side coming along?
Tom:    Pretty well, actually.
        I've been tweaking the layouts based on the guidelines you shared.
Sophie: That's good to hear.
        Do you think the users have noticed the improvements?
Tom:    I think so.
        We haven't been receiving as many negative comments.
Sophie: That's a relief.
        How long do you think we'll need to keep making adjustments?
Tom:    Probably a few more weeks.
        We've been making steady progress,
        and I believe we're close to finalizing the major changes.
Sophie: That's good news. It feels great to make our app more accessible.
