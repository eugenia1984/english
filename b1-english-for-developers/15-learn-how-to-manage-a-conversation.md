```
Alice:  Hey, James.
        Sorry for the interruption earlier.
        Can we pick up where we left off?
James:  Sure, Alice.
        We were talking about the new project requirements,
        right?
Alice:  Yes, that's right.
        So, as I was saying,
        we need to adjust the timeline
        because of the recent changes.
        Does that work for you?
James:  It does,
        but I need a little bit more clarification.
        By the way,
        did we decide on the deadline for the first phase?
Alice:  Not yet.
        I was hoping we could discuss it today.
        What do you think about setting it for the end of next month?
James:  That should work.
        Oh, and we need to confirm with the client
        about the new requirements.
        Do you have time to do that?
Alice:  Yes, I'll take care of it.
        And if you don't mind,
        could you send me the updated project plan?
James:  Sure thing.
        I'll send it over.
        Anything else we should discuss
        before our next meeting?
Alice:  I think that's it for now.
        Thanks for your help.
James:  No problem.
        Talk to you later.

### To be sorry for something

**To be sorry for something** is used when apologizing for an action that may have caused inconvenience or harm. For example: `I'm sorry for being late to the meeting`. -> This means the speaker regrets arriving late and is apologizing. Notice that being is in the -ing form as it is right after for (a preposition).

### Pick up & Leave off

- **To pick up** means to continue something that was previously paused. For example: `Let's pick up this discussion after lunch`. -> This means continuing the discussion later.

- **To leave off** refers to the point where something stopped. For example: `Where did we leave off in the book?` -> This asks about the last part read before stopping.

### Does that work for you?

**Does that work for you?** is used to ask if something is acceptable or convenient for someone. For example: `We can meet at 2 PM. Does that work for you?` -> This asks if 2 PM is a good time for the other person.

```
Jessica:  Excuse me, Tom.
          I'm sorry to interrupt,
          but I need to bring up an urgent issue
          with the latest software update.
          Would it be okay to discuss it briefly?
Tom:      Sure, Jessica.
          What seems to be the problem?
Jessica:  Well, we've discovered a critical bug
          that might affect the user interface.
          It could cause some display issues,
          and I thought you'd want to know about it
          before we proceed further.
Tom:      Thanks for letting me know.
          Could you tell me more about the bug?
          How severe is it?
Jessica:  It seems to be causing
          certain elements to disappear under specific conditions.
          It's a serious issue,
          and we need to address it quickly.
Tom:      I understand.
          Do we need to inform the rest of the team,
          or can we handle it here?
Jessica:  If you don't mind,
          I'd like to take a few minutes
          to explain it to the rest of the team.
          It might impact their work as well.
Tom:      That's fine.
          Go ahead.
          I'm sure everyone will appreciate knowing about it.
Jessica:  Thank you.
          I appreciate your understanding.
          I'll try to be quick
          so we can get back to the main agenda.
Tom:      No problem.
          Thanks for bringing this up.
          It's important to deal with these issues early.
