## Dialogue 1: A Debugging Session Recap

```
Lisa:   Hey, James.
        Did you find that bug we were stuck on yesterday?
James:  Yes, I did. It was quite a hunt.
        First, I checked the recent changes we made to the code.
Lisa:   What did you find there?
James:  Nothing at first.
        Then I reviewed the error logs more carefully.
        That's when I noticed something odd.
Lisa:   What was it?
James:  The system wasn't connecting to the database properly.
        After that, I realized we didn't update the database credentials after the last security patch.
Lisa:   Ah, so the credentials were the issue.
        Did you fix them?
James:  Yes, I updated the credentials and the connection was finally successful.
        The app started working again.
Lisa:   Great job. Wasn't it stressful though?
James:  A bit, but solving problems like these is what makes our job interesting, right?
Lisa:   Absolutely.
        Thanks for handling it, James.
        Did anything else come up while you were debugging?
James:  Not really.
        Everything else was running smoothly once the database issue was fixed.
Lisa:   Perfect.
        Let's make sure we double check credentials after security updates in the future.

### The Simple Past structure for forming questions 

Starts with **did + subject + base form of the verb**. 

You use **did** to show the action happened in the past, but **keep the main verb (e.g., find) in its base form**. 

For example:

`Did they finish the report on time?` -> You want to know if the report was concluded before it was due.

`Did she call you yesterday?` -> You want to know if the person received a call the day before.


## The Simple Past - short answers

When giving short answers to a question directed to you about something you did or did not do in the past, use **Yes, I did** or **No, I didn't** to answer to them briefly. For example:

`Did you buy that car you wanted? No, I didn't.` -> This means you did not buy the car.

`Did you pass the English test? Yes, I did.` -> This means you passed the test.
