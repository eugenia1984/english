```
Lisa:   Hey, James.
        Did you find that bug we were stuck on yesterday?
James:  Yes, I did. It was quite a hunt.
        First, I checked the recent changes we made to the code.
Lisa:   What did you find there?
James:  Nothing at first.
        Then I reviewed the error logs more carefully.
        That's when I noticed something odd.
Lisa:   What was it?
James:  The system wasn't connecting to the database properly.
        After that, I realized we didn't update the database credentials after the last security patch.
Lisa:   Ah, so the credentials were the issue.
        Did you fix them?
James:  Yes, I updated the credentials and the connection was finally successful.
        The app started working again.
Lisa:   Great job. Wasn't it stressful though?
James:  A bit, but solving problems like these is what makes our job interesting, right?
Lisa:   Absolutely.
        Thanks for handling it, James.
        Did anything else come up while you were debugging?
James:  Not really.
        Everything else was running smoothly once the database issue was fixed.
Lisa:   Perfect.
        Let's make sure we double check credentials after security updates in the future.

### The Simple Past structure for forming questions 

Starts with **did + subject + base form of the verb**. 

You use **did** to show the action happened in the past, but **keep the main verb (e.g., find) in its base form**. 

For example:

`Did they finish the report on time?` -> You want to know if the report was concluded before it was due.

`Did she call you yesterday?` -> You want to know if the person received a call the day before.


## The Simple Past - short answers

When giving short answers to a question directed to you about something you did or did not do in the past, use **Yes, I did** or **No, I didn't** to answer to them briefly. For example:

`Did you buy that car you wanted? No, I didn't.` -> This means you did not buy the car.

`Did you pass the English test? Yes, I did.` -> This means you passed the test.

### Simple Past tense in affirmative sentences

You use the Simple Past tense in affirmative sentences when you want to talk about completed actions at a moment in the past.

In the Simple Past, **regular verbs** like check are formed by **adding -ed** to the base verb. 

**Irregular verbs**, such as make, **have unique forms that do not follow this rule**. 

In James's sentence: **Checked** is the past form of the regular verb **check**, indicating an action that was completed in the past.

For example: 

`He checked his email before the meeting.` -> He looked at the e-mails at a moment in the past prior to the meeting.

**Made** is the past form of the irregular verb **make**, indicating something that was created or done in the past. For example:

`She made a list of items to buy.` -> She created a list of what she wanted to buy before going to the store.


### Affirmative sentences in the Simple Past follow specific rules:

For the verb to be, the forms are **was** (singular) and **were** (plural). These forms are used without auxiliary verbs. For example:

`The project was successful.` -> This means the project brought good results.

`They were happy with the results.` -> this represents how they felt about the results of the project.

**Regular verbs in the Simple Past are formed by adding -ed to the base verb**. For example:

`I worked on the project yesterday.` - You add **-ed** to the base form of the verb work to say that the action happened in a moment in the past.


### In negative questions with the verb to be in the Simple Past, use the structure Wasn't/Weren't + subject + complement?

This structure is often used to confirm something or to express surprise or doubt. For example:

`Wasn't she at the meeting yesterday?` -> You are not only asking about her being at the meeting, you are trying to confirm it because you think she was.

`Weren't they informed about the changes?` -> You are trying to confirm if they were informed or not.


### Sequential linkers like first, then, after that, and finally are used to describe the order of actions or events.

**First** is used to describe the initial action.

**Then** refers to the next immediate step.

**After that** is used to introduce a step following another action with some distinction between them.

**Finally** marks the last step in a sequence.

```
Linda:  I was thinking we could do a quick post-mortem of the design project.
Jake:   Sure.
        I was reviewing our security protocols for the project just yesterday.
        What's on your mind?
Linda:  Well, during the project, I was working closely with the development team,
        and we were constantly updating the user interface based on user feedback.
Jake:   I noticed that.
        But there was a time when we weren't considering security implications during those updates, right?
Linda:  Yes, that's true.
        We used to focus solely on design aspects and user experience.
        Did you use to check the updates for security vulnerabilities?
Jake:   I did, but not always in real time.
        Sometimes I was checking them a day later, which wasn't ideal.
Linda:  I remember there was a week when we were all working overtime.
        You were fixing a security issue, weren't you?
Jake:   Exactly.
        There was a major vulnerability that needed immediate action.
        While I was addressing that, the team was waiting for my green light to proceed.
Linda:  It was quite a learning curve for us.
        We didn't use to integrate security and design as much as we should.
Jake:   Agreed.
        Moving forward, we should ensure that security checks are happening while the design updates are being made.
        We can't afford to overlook this aspect again.
```

### Past Continuous

The Past Continuous tense is used **to describe actions or thoughts that were in progress at a specific time in the past**.

This tense is often used **to describe background actions or ongoing processes in the past**. 

The structure is **was/were + verb ending in -ing**.

Examples: 

`He was reviewing the report when the meeting started.` -> Meaning that the action of reviewing the report was in progress and another situation interrupted it.

The Past Continuous tense is used to describe actions that were ongoing at a specific time in the past. **When two Past Continuous sentences are used together, they often describe simultaneous actions or actions happening alongside each other**.

`While I was preparing the report, they were testing the new features.` -> This means the action of my preparing the report and the testing of the new features happened at the same time.


### Past Continuous - Negative form

The Past Continuous in it's negative form is used to describe actions that were not happening at a specific time in the past. 

The structure is: **wasn't / weren't + verb ending in -ing**. 

For example:

`He wasn't listening during the meeting.` -> This sentence uses the singular form was

`They weren't following the instructions carefully.` -> This sentence uses the plural form were.

In this context, weren't considering means that, at a certain point in the past, the team was not taking security implications into account while performing updates.


### Past Continuous - Tag question

Tag questions are short questions added to the end of a statement to confirm information or seek agreement. 

The structure depends on the main sentence: 

-**If the main sentence is positive, the tag is negative**. 

For example:

`You were working late, weren't you?` -> You want to confirm if the other person was working late - you believe they were.

-**If the main sentence is negative, the tag is positive**. 

For Example:

`You weren't at the meeting, were you?` -> You want to confirm if the person did not attend the meeting - you believe they didn't.
