```
Sarah: Thanks for meeting with me today.
       We need to wrap up the list
       of components for our next product batch.
       This list here shows what we're looking at.
Josh:  No problem at all.
       I see this item at the top.
       Do you need many of these or just a few?
Sarah: We're actually looking for quite a few of those.
       They're crucial for our new design.
       Last time we ordered 20.
       This time we might need double that.
Josh:  Got it.
       Those resistors right there,
       are they the same ones you needed last time
       or something better?
Sarah: Those are the ones,
       but we found something even better in your catalog.
       These high capacity ones here.
       Could we get a sample of those first
       before we make a large order?
Josh:  Certainly.
       I can send those over by next week.
       How about these cables?
       You mentioned needing more than usual.
Sarah: Yes, those cables were a bit short last time.
       We need something longer,
       maybe twice as long as the ones we got before.
Joah:  Understood.
       I'll check what lengths we have in stock.
       For these connectors,
       are these standard types sufficient
       or do you need the highest quality that we offer?
Sarah: We'd prefer the highest quality for those connectors
       since they impact the product's performance significantly.
       Also, could you ensure we receive all the materials
       by the end of the month?
Josh:  Absolutly. I'll prioritized-
       I'll draft a new quote with these specifics
       and send it over to you by tomorrow.
       Does that work for you?
Sarah: Perfect, Josh.
       Thank you for the quick turnaround.
       Let's touch base once I review the quote.
```

### Many / A few

- **many of these**: means a large number of specific items being talked about. For example: `We need many of these parts to finish the job`. –> This means a high quantity is required.

- **a few**: means a small number, but more than one. For example: `I have a few questions`. –> This means you have a small number of questions.
