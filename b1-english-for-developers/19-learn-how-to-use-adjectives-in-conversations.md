```
Sarah: Thanks for meeting with me today.
       We need to wrap up the list
       of components for our next product batch.
       This list here shows what we're looking at.
Josh:  No problem at all.
       I see this item at the top.
       Do you need many of these or just a few?
Sarah: We're actually looking for quite a few of those.
       They're crucial for our new design.
       Last time we ordered 20.
       This time we might need double that.
Josh:  Got it.
       Those resistors right there,
       are they the same ones you needed last time
       or something better?
Sarah: Those are the ones,
       but we found something even better in your catalog.
       These high capacity ones here.
       Could we get a sample of those first
       before we make a large order?
Josh:  Certainly.
       I can send those over by next week.
       How about these cables?
       You mentioned needing more than usual.
Sarah: Yes, those cables were a bit short last time.
       We need something longer,
       maybe twice as long as the ones we got before.
Joah:  Understood.
       I'll check what lengths we have in stock.
       For these connectors,
       are these standard types sufficient
       or do you need the highest quality that we offer?
Sarah: We'd prefer the highest quality for those connectors
       since they impact the product's performance significantly.
       Also, could you ensure we receive all the materials
       by the end of the month?
Josh:  Absolutely. I'll prioritize these orders.
       I'll draft a new quote with these specifics
       and send it over to you by tomorrow.
       Does that work for you?
Sarah: Perfect, Josh.
       Thank you for the quick turnaround.
       Let's touch base once I review the quote.
```

### Many... / A few... / Quite a few... / Double that... / Something better... / Even better... / Sufficient / Highest quality... / Significantly

- **many of these**: means a large number of specific items being talked about. For example: `We need many of these parts to finish the job`. –> This means a high quantity is required.

- **a few**: means a small number, but more than one. For example: `I have a few questions`. –> This means you have a small number of questions.

- **quite a few**: means a larger number than just a few. For example: `There were quite a few people at the meeting`. –> This means many people attended.

- **double that**: means twice the previous quantity. For example: `Last time we ordered 10 routers; this time we need double that, so 20 routers`. –> This shows the quantity has increased two times.
 
- **something better**: means an improved or higher-quality option compared to a previous one. For example: We found something better than the old processor`. –> This means the team found a newer or more powerful processor.

- **even better**: means something is an improvement compared to another good option. For example: `We thought the laptop was good, but we found something even better with more power`. –> This shows finding a stronger or more advanced option.

- **sufficient**: means enough to satisfy a requirement or need. For example: `The memory storage is sufficient for running the software`. –> This means the storage is enough without needing more.

- **highest quality**: means the best available level of performance or reliability. For example: `We chose the highest quality cables for the server setup`. –> This shows selecting the best option for important work.

### Twice / Longer / As long as

- **longer**: means having more distance from end to end. For example: `We need longer cables to reach the new server racks`. –> This means cables with more length.

- **twice**: means two times the amount. For example: `We ordered twice the number of processors this time`. –> This means double the quantity.

- **as long as**: is used for direct comparison in length. For example: `The new cable is as long as the room`. –> This shows the cable's length matches the size of the room.

- **significantly**: means in a major or important way. For example: `The new software significantly reduced loading times` –> This means it made a big improvement.

```
Jake:  All right, Alice,
       here's how I plan to start the pitch.
       In today's fast evolving digital landscape,
       startups require a robust,
       cost-effective cybersecurity solution.
       Guardian Tech offers just that,
       an innovative and flexible suite
       that grows with your business.
ALice: That sounds really good, Jake.
       You used 'robust' and 'cost-effective',
       which highlights the most important qualities right away.
       Maybe consider emphasizing how essential these features are?
Jake:  Hmm... Okay. How about this?
       Guardian Tech isn't just helpful.
       It's essential for protecting against
       the wide array of digital threats facing startups today.
       Our solution is not only adaptable
       but also incredibly easy to integrate
       into any existing infrastructure.
Alice: Yes, that's clearer.
       You're showing the urgency
       and ease of integration well.
       When you talk about integration,
       maybe specify what makes it easy?
Jake:  Good point. I'll add:
       With its plug-and-play design,
       GuardianTech is a user-friendly option
       that requires minimal setup time.
       This seamless integration
       makes it an ideal choice
       for startups with limited IT resources.
Alice: Perfect!
       That part about 'minimal setup time' really clarifies it.
       How will you conclude the pitch?
Jake:  I was thinking of finishing with a focus on the future.
       Like:
       As your startup grows,
       GuardianTech scales effortlessly
       to meet increasing demands ensuring a secure,
       sustainable digital environment.
Alice: That's a strong ending.
       It reassures that the product is a long-term solution.
       Just make sure to slow down a bit when you get to
       'secure, sustainable digital environment'
       to let those adjectives sink in.
Jake:  Definitely.
       I'll make a note of that.
       Thanks for the feedback, Alice.
       I feel much more confident
       about delivering this pitch now.
