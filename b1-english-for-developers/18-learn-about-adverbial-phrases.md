```
Bob:   Today,
       I want to focus on optimizing our daily huddle meetings
       to ensure we're using our time effectively.
       First off,
       let's discuss the frequency of our updates.
       Sarah,
       can you tell me how often
       the team currently discusses back-end development?
Sarah: Currently we meet every morning to review progress and issues.
       But to be honest,
       we often end up talking about details
       that haven't changed from the day before.
Bob:   That's a valid concern.
       Let's think about reducing redundancy.
       How about we switch to biweekly detailed updates
       unless there's a significant development?
       For daily meetings,
       a quick status check should be enough.
Sarah: That sounds like a good approach to me.
       Limiting our full team updates to twice a week,
       we can concentrate on changes or urgent issues.
       We might also consider having weekly updates
       for part of the project where changes are less frequent.
Bob:   I like that approach.
       You know what?
       We should set specific times for these updates.
       How about scheduling the detailed biweekly meetings
       for Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9 a.m.?
Sarah: That works perfectly.
       I'll keep track of how these changes impact
       our workflow and compile a report
       by the end of the month.
Bob:   Excellent, Sarah.
       We'll review your report
       and feedback from the team
       to see if these adjustments meet our needs
       or if further modifications are necessary.
       It's crucial that our meetings
       are as productive as possible.
```

### Adverbial phrase

An adverbial phrase is a word or group of words that works together to modify a verb, adjective, or other adverb, providing additional information about time, frequency, manner, place, or degree. 

Sarah uses two adverbial phrases that describe the frequency of the meeting:

**Currently** -> is an adverb that refers to the present time. It indicates that the action is happening now, in the present moment. For example: `Currently, we are testing the new software`. -> It means the testing is happening at the present time.

**Every morning** -> is an adverbial phrase that describes frequency, indicating how often the meetings occur. For example: `She exercises every morning before work`. -> It means she exercises daily, specifically in the morning.

These phrases help provide more context and give the listener or reader a better understanding of when and how frequently the actions take place.
