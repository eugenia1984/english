```
Jake:  Maria, the next system update is scheduled for this Saturday at 2am.
       It's crucial to enhance our firewall settings to prevent any potential denial of service attacks.
Maria: Yes, Jake.
       I've reviewed the timetable.
       The server downtime starts exactly when the user traffic is at its lowest, correct?
Jake:  That's right.
       The update should last about two hours.
       Our main goal is to minimize disruption while strengthening our defenses.
Maria: Will the support team be on call during the update?
       We need to make sure they're ready to handle any immediate issues that come up.
Jake:  Absolutely.
       The entire technical support team will be on duty.
       They've been briefed and are prepared to manage any unexpected situations.
Maria: Great.
       And when does the team perform the final checks?
Jake:  The final system checks are set for Friday night.
       We'll confirm that all security patches are ready to be deployed without any complications.
Maria: Perfect.
       And the training session for the new security protocols, when is that planned?
Jake:  The training is planned for Thursday afternoon.
       Every team member must understand the changes and how these will impact our operations.

### Future: will - affirmative

**Will** -> indicate the Future Simple tense, showing that the action is expected to happen.

The structure **will + verb** is commonly used to talk about future events, plans, or predictions. 

For example:

`They will be at the meeting tomorrow`. -> This means their presence is planned for the future.

`We will start the project next week`. -> This means the project is scheduled to begin in the future.


*TIP* -> **Using will is a straightforward way to express future intentions, promises, or schedules-**


### Future: will - question

Te structure **Will + subject + verb** to **ask about a planned event in the future**.

This structure is common in formal questions about future arrangements. For example:

`Will the meeting start at 10 AM?` -> This is asking if the meeting is scheduled to begin at that specific time.

`Will they join us for dinner?` -> This is asking if they have plans to come to dinner.

```
Jake:   Sarah, I just found out that we've had a phishing attack on our system.
        It looks like someone will need to notify the team and take immediate action.
Sarah:  Oh, no. Do you know where it originated from?
Jake:   Not yet, but I think it came from an email link.
        We need to investigate quickly.
        I'll send out a warning to everyone right away.
Sarah:  That sounds like a good plan.
        Do you think it will affect our project deadlines?
Jake:   It might.
        I hope it won't, but we should prepare for delays.
        I'll update the project manager about the situation.
Sarah:  I'll alert the development team and tell them to check their emails carefully.
        Is there anything else we should do?
Jake:   We'll probably need to run a full system scan to ensure that there's no hidden malware.
        Can you coordinate with the IT support team for that?
Sarah:  Yes, I'll contact them now.
        How do you think our clients will react to this news?
Jake:   They'll likely be concerned,
        but I'll reassure them that we're taking all necessary steps to secure our systems.
Sarah:  Thanks, Jake.
        Let's meet later to discuss the investigation results and plan our next steps.
```

### Future - will 

**Will** is used **to express a decision made at the moment of speaking, often when someone reacts to a situation**. It is **a way to show spontaneity or immediate response**. 

For example:

`I will call the manager right away`. -> This shows a decision made at the moment in response to a need.

### Future: I'll (I will) & Won't (will not)

- **I'll** is the contraction for **I will**. It is commonly used to express decisions made at the moment of speaking or to indicate future actions.

For example:

`I'll call the manager now.` -> This shows a decision made at the moment of speaking.

`I'll help you with your project.` -> This means offering help immediately after hearing about the need.


- **Won't** is the contraction for **will not**, which is used to make negative sentences about the future.

For example:

`They won't finish the project on time if they don't start now.` -> This predicts a negative outcome if action isn't taken.

`He won't attend the meeting because he is sick`. -> This shows a future action that will not happen.
