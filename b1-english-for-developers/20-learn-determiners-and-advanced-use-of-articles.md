```
Jake:  Maria, as we expand globally,
       we need to ensure our cloud storage meets
       our capacity and security needs.
       I've checked out a few options
       focusing on data centers in Europe and North America.
Maria: That's great, Jake.
       Since our data is sensitive,
       choosing the right location is crucial,
       specially with the strict rules in Europe.
       What options are we considering?
Jake:  I've narrowed it down to two main providers.
       One has data centers mostly in the U.S.,
       offering strong security features at a lower cost.
       The other provider has data centers in Europe,
       giving better privacy but at a higher price.
Maria: Security and cost are important,
       but we also need to think about speed and growth.
       Our developers have said
       there are slowdowns with our current provider,
       especially during busy times.
Jake:  That's a good point.
       The European option might reduce slowdowns
       for our European customers
       and improve performance.
       But we need to balance that with higher costs.
Maria: Can we try out the European provider?
       Testing it in real situations
       could give us better insights into its performance.
Jake:  That's a practical idea.
       I'll arrange for a test project within the next month.
       We'll track key performance details
       and get feedback from the team.
Maria: Great, Jake.
       Let's also ensure
       that the provider we choose
       can grow with us without needing big changes.
Jake:  Agreed.
       I'll include growth plans in our tests
       and review the support services
       to see how helpful they are with tech issues.
Maria: Thanks, Jake.
       Keep me updated on the test's progress
       and prepare a detailed comparison report.
       We should go over it together to make a final choice.
Jake:  Will do, Maria.
       I'll make sure everything is carefully tested
       so we can choose a solution
       that balances performance, cost, security, and compliance.
```

### Our

- **our** -> is a possessive determiner. It shows that something belongs to a group that includes the speaker.

For example: `Our team finished the project on time`. -> The team that you are part of did it.

### Zero article / The - for places

- **Zero article** -> is used with most **continent** and **country names**: Europe, Asia, North America, Germany, etc.

- **The** is used with **groups** or **plural names**, like: the Netherlands, the United States, or the Philippines.

### Proper noun

Europe is a proper noun (continent name), and in general English, you don't use articles before continent names.

### The

- **The** -> is a definite article used before nouns that are already known or specific.  For example: `The location to refer to a specific location they are choosing`. or `The rules to refer to known legal rules in Europe.

### What

**What** -> is an interrogative determiner used to ask about things or options. It comes before a noun in questions. 

For example:

`What language are you coding in?` -> This asks which programming language someone is using.

`What changes did you make in the code?` -> This asks someone to explain what they edited or updated.

```
Bob:   As we start the new mobile app project,
       we need to decide who will do what.
       Each developer will have their own tasks.
Alice: That's a great idea.
       We have many features to work on,
       and our developers have different skills.
       How are we going to assign these tasks?
Bob:   We'll match tasks to each developer's skills.
       Sarah will take care of user authentication
       because she has the most experience there.
       Tom will work on payment integration.
Alice: What about those new developers
       we started onboarding a few weeks ago?
Bob:   Each new developer will work
       with someone more experienced.
       This way, every new person
       gets help and no one feels too stressed.
Alice: That makes sense.
       Do we have any plans
       for how often we'll check their progress?
Bob:   Yes. We'll meet every two weeks
       to talk about how everyone is doing
       and to solve any problems.
       It's important
       that no part of the project gets delayed.
Alice: I'm not sure we have enough QA people
       to test all the new features, though.
Bob:   Agreed.
       We're a little short on testers right now.
       I'm considering bringing in
       a couple more people for this project.
       I'll talk to HR
       and see if we can get some more help.
Alice: That would be great.
       Proper testing is crucial,
       especially for the more complex parts of the app.
Bob:   Definitely.
       I'll make sure we have all the resources we need.
       Let's make sure everyone knows their responsibilities
       by the end of this week.
Alice: I'll get started on a list of technical requirements
       for each part of the project
       to help us assign tasks correctly.
```

### The

When you talk about a specific thing that both the speaker and the listener know, you use **the**.

### Each / Their

- **Each** ->  is used to talk about every single member of a group separately. For example: `Each team member has a different role`. -> Every person in the team does something different.

- **Their** ->  is a possessive determiner that matches plural meaning without showing gender (his/her). For example: `They updated their software yesterday`. -> The software that belongs to them was updated.


### A / Many / our

`A great idea`->  uses **a** because it introduces **a new, singular thing**.

`Many features` ->  uses **many** because it refers to **a large number of countable things**.

`Our developers`-> uses **our** to show **ownership** - the developers are part of Alice's group.

### These

These is a demonstrative determiner used for plural nouns that are close to the speaker in time or situation. For example:

`These files need to be reviewed today`. -> The files that are here (near the speaker) must be checked today.

`I like these new features in the app`. -> You enjoy the new features that were just added.
