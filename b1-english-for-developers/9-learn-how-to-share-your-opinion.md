```
Linda: I think Python is the best language for beginners.
       It's easy to learn and it has tons of libraries,
       especially for design work.
Tom:   I see.
       Well, I think JavaScript is more versatile.
       You can use it for web design
       and it has some great tools for creating animations.
Linda: In my case,
       I prefer Python because it's great for data analysis.
       Plus it's really good for building prototypes quickly.
Tom:   I'm not a fan of Python syntax.
       It feels a bit rigid.
       I find JavaScript more flexible
       and it's the go-to language for front-end development.
Linda: That's true,
       but Python works better for back-end stuff.
       You can do a lot with it,
       especially for automation and data-driven projects.
Tom:   I'd rather stick with JavaScript
       because it fits my graphic design work.
       It's perfect for creating interactive elements on websites.

### Prefer + noun in -ing form


Prefer is typically followed by a noun or the -ing form of a verb. 

For example:

`Users often prefer apps with simple and clean designs`. -> People usually choose apps that are easy to navigate and visually appealing.

`Some people prefer using dark mode to reduce eye strain`. -> Many users choose dark mode because it's easier on their eyes.

### Great for... and Good for... 

Both **great for** and **good for** mean something is very helpful, suitable or effective for a specific purpose. 

For example:

`This new software is great for managing large projects`. -> This means the software is very suitable and effective for managing large projects.

Cloud storage is good for backing up large volumes of data`. -> This means cloud storage is highly effective and well-suited for safely storing large amounts of data.
