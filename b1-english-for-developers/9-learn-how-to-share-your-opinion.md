```
Linda: I think Python is the best language for beginners.
       It's easy to learn and it has tons of libraries,
       especially for design work.
Tom:   I see.
       Well, I think JavaScript is more versatile.
       You can use it for web design
       and it has some great tools for creating animations.
Linda: In my case,
       I prefer Python because it's great for data analysis.
       Plus it's really good for building prototypes quickly.
Tom:   I'm not a fan of Python syntax.
       It feels a bit rigid.
       I find JavaScript more flexible
       and it's the go-to language for front-end development.
Linda: That's true,
       but Python works better for back-end stuff.
       You can do a lot with it,
       especially for automation and data-driven projects.
Tom:   I'd rather stick with JavaScript
       because it fits my graphic design work.
       It's perfect for creating interactive elements on websites.
```

### Prefer + noun in -ing form


Prefer is typically followed by a noun or the -ing form of a verb. 

For example:

`Users often prefer apps with simple and clean designs`. -> People usually choose apps that are easy to navigate and visually appealing.

`Some people prefer using dark mode to reduce eye strain`. -> Many users choose dark mode because it's easier on their eyes.

### Great for... and Good for... 

Both **great for** and **good for** mean something is very helpful, suitable or effective for a specific purpose. 

For example:

`This new software is great for managing large projects`. -> This means the software is very suitable and effective for managing large projects.

Cloud storage is good for backing up large volumes of data`. -> This means cloud storage is highly effective and well-suited for safely storing large amounts of data.

```
Maria:  We need to choose a development environment for the new project.
        Do you have any preferences?
Jake:   I prefer using Visual Studio Code
        because it's lightweight and has excellent security features.
Maria:  I see your point, but I like IntelliJ IDEA.
        It has robust tools for code refactoring,
        which makes it easier for the team to maintain the code base.
Jake:   That's true,
        but Visual Studio Code has a large selection of extensions.
        It's customizable,
        which is useful for our different teams.
Maria:  I understand,
        but IntelliJ IDEA integrates well with various build tools.
        It also has built-in support for version control,
        which we rely on a lot.
Jake:   That's a good reason,
        but wouldn't we need something that can easily detect vulnerabilities?
        Visual Studio Code has security plugins that are really helpful for that.
Maria:  Good point,
        but IntelliJ IDEA has a strong debugging feature,
        which can save us time during development.
        Since we often need to debug complex code,
        it's a significant advantage.
Jake:   Okay, let's agree to disagree.
        Maybe we should see what the rest of the team prefers,
        since it won't just be the two of us working on this project.
```

### Wouldn't 

**Wouldn't** is **a contraction of would not**, used to form a question, often **to express doubt or inquire about something**. 

For example:

`The system should be secure, but wouldn't it be safer with extra testing?` -> In this case, the speaker is questioning whether more testing is needed to make the system safer.
