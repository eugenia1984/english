```
Anna:  Brian, we really need to hash out the updates to our remote work policy.
       There's been a lot of back and forth on what should be included.
Brian: Absolutely, Anna. It's crucial that we iron out these details soon.
       Let's start by phasing out the old clause about mandatory in-office days.
       It's not fitting our current model.
Anna:  I agree.
       We should also lay down some guidelines for communication during remote work.
       Making sure that everyone is on the same page will help streamline our operations.
Brian: Definitely.
       On another note,
       we need to touch base on the employee feedback regarding annual leave.
       Some people feel like the process to apply is a bit inefficient.
Anna:  That's a good point.
       Perhaps we can simplify it by cutting down unnecessary steps.
       Making it easy to apply should encourage more people
       to take the time off they need without feeling bogged down.
Brian: Right. And while we're at it,
       let's wrap up the section on professional development.
       We should encourage staff to branch out in their skills
       without making it sound too daunting.
Anna:  Great idea, Brian.
       Encouraging growth is key.
       How about we put together a draft of these changes
       and run it by the team leads before we roll it out company-wide?
Brian: Sounds like a plan.
       I'll draft up the changes
       and set up a meeting with the team leads next week.
       We can iron out any kinks, then get everyone's buy-in.
Anna:  Perfect, Brian.
       Thanks for helping to make these policies clearer.
       It's important that they reflect our company's values
       and current work environment.
Brian: My pleasure, Anna.
       Let's make sure these policies do just that.

### Idiomatic expressions

Idiomatic expressions are phrases whose meanings are different from the literal meanings of the words. They represent common ways of speaking that often cannot be understood just by looking at each word.

- **Back and forth**: is an idiomatic expression meaning a repeated movement or exchange between two points or ideas. In the dialogue, it means ongoing discussion with different opinions or ideas shared repeatedly. Another example: `There was a lot of back and forth between the team members before deciding on the design`. –> This means the team members discussed many times before reaching a decision.

- **To iron out**: means to solve or settle small problems or differences, especially through discussion or careful planning. For example: `We need to iron out the final issues before launching the website`. –> This means the team needs to fix the last few problems before the website goes live.

- **To fit**: means to match or be suitable for a situation, system, or structure. For example: `That idea isn't fitting our new approach to team management`. –> This means the idea doesn't work well with the way the team now operates.

- **To be on the same page**: means that people share the same understanding or agreement about something. For example: `Let's meet before the presentation to make sure we're on the same page`. –> This means making sure everyone understands the topic the same way before presenting.

- **On another note**: is used to introduce a new topic in a conversation. For example: `On another note, have you seen the new project updates?` –> This means the speaker is changing the subject.

- **To touch base on something**: means to make contact or have a brief discussion about a topic. For example: `We should touch base on the client's feedback before the meeting`. –> This means having a short talk about what the client said.

- **To take time off**: means to stop working for a period of time, usually for rest, vacation, or personal reasons. For example: `I'm taking time off next week to visit my family.` –> This means the person will not work next week and will spend time with their family instead.

- **To branch out in something**: means to try new activities or develop new skills that are different from what you normally do. For example: `She's branching out in her role by learning about project management`. –> This means she is expanding her abilities beyond her usual job tasks.

- **To put something together**: means to create or organize something by combining different parts. For example: `We need to put together a presentation for the client`. –> This means preparing a full presentation by organizing slides, ideas, and information.

### Prefix -un

The prefix un- is added to adjectives **to create the opposite meaning**. 

In `unnecessary`, the base word is `necessary (meaning needed), and un- makes it mean "not needed". 

Another example: `It was an unfair decision`. – `Unfair` is the opposite of `fair, meaning not just or not equal.
