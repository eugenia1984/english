```
Bob:  Anna, I've been reviewing the survey results for the remote work stipend.
      It seems most people prefer using it for office furniture.
      Do you think that's a good idea?
Anna: I don't think so, Bob.
      While furniture is important,
      many people mentioned that their computers need upgrades.
      This might be more critical for productivity.
Bob:  I understand,
      but isn't office furniture also a priority?
      I mean, a lot of people are working from home with makeshift setups.
      A comfortable desk and a chair can make a big difference.
Anna: Not necessarily.
      Having the latest technology can be just as important.
      If people are working with outdated computers,
      it can be a setback for productivity.
Bob:  True, but good office furniture can prevent health issues
      that result from bad posture and make remote work more enjoyable
Anna: I agree that comfort is important,
      but we shouldn't neglect technology.
Bob:  So maybe we should focus on both.
      Find a balance between
      comfort and technology to ensure everyone has what they need.
Anna: That makes sense.
      Let's see how we can adjust the stipend
      to cover both technology and office furniture.
Bob:  Good plan.
      Thanks for discussing this with me, Anna.
Anna: No problem, Bob.
      Let's work on the details.
