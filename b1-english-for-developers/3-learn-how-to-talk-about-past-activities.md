```
James: Have you seen the latest user feedback?
        They've mentioned some elements of our homepage aren't displaying correctly on mobile devices.
Linda: Yes, I've reviewed the reports.
       It seems we've got a UI display issue across different screen sizes.
James: Have we fixed anything like this before?
Linda: No, we haven't, but we've solved similar issues on other projects.
James: Have you had the time to identify which elements are causing the trouble?
Linda: Yes, I have.
       The navigation bar and the footer haven't been adapting well to smaller screens.
James: Have we received any detailed reports from users about this issue?
Linda: Yes, a few actually.
       They've emailed us screenshots showing how elements overlap on their devices.
James: Alright, what's our next step?
       Has the development team been informed about this?
Linda: Not yet, but I've scheduled a meeting for tomorrow morning.
       We'll go over the proposed fixes and decide on the best approach.
