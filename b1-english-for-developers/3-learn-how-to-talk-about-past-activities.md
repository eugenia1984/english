```
James: Have you seen the latest user feedback?
        They've mentioned some elements of our homepage aren't displaying correctly on mobile devices.
Linda: Yes, I've reviewed the reports.
       It seems we've got a UI display issue across different screen sizes.
James: Have we fixed anything like this before?
Linda: No, we haven't, but we've solved similar issues on other projects.
James: Have you had the time to identify which elements are causing the trouble?
Linda: Yes, I have.
       The navigation bar and the footer haven't been adapting well to smaller screens.
James: Have we received any detailed reports from users about this issue?
Linda: Yes, a few actually.
       They've emailed us screenshots showing how elements overlap on their devices.
James: Alright, what's our next step?
       Has the development team been informed about this?
Linda: Not yet, but I've scheduled a meeting for tomorrow morning.
       We'll go over the proposed fixes and decide on the best approach.

### Present Perfect

The Present Perfect tense is used **to talk about actions or experiences that happened at some point before now.**

Use this structure **to talk about something that happened before now, but where the exact time isn't important.**

To form the Present Perfect tense, use **have or has followed by the past participle of the verb**.

The past participle of the verb see is seen. It's **irregular**, which means it doesn't just **add -ed** like regular verbs. 

For example:

`I have seen the report.` -> At some point before now, you saw the report.

`She has seen the report.` -> At some point before now, she saw the report.


- In the Present Perfect tense, **contractions often combine the subject and the auxiliary verb have or has**. 

For example: `They have` becomes `They've`. / `He has` becomes `He's`.
