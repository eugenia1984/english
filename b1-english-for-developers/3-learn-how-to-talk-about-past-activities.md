```
James: Have you seen the latest user feedback?
        They've mentioned some elements of our homepage aren't displaying correctly on mobile devices.
Linda: Yes, I've reviewed the reports.
       It seems we've got a UI display issue across different screen sizes.
James: Have we fixed anything like this before?
Linda: No, we haven't, but we've solved similar issues on other projects.
James: Have you had the time to identify which elements are causing the trouble?
Linda: Yes, I have.
       The navigation bar and the footer haven't been adapting well to smaller screens.
James: Have we received any detailed reports from users about this issue?
Linda: Yes, a few actually.
       They've emailed us screenshots showing how elements overlap on their devices.
James: Alright, what's our next step?
       Has the development team been informed about this?
Linda: Not yet, but I've scheduled a meeting for tomorrow morning.
       We'll go over the proposed fixes and decide on the best approach.

### Present Perfect

The Present Perfect tense is used **to talk about actions or experiences that happened at some point before now.**

Use this structure **to talk about something that happened before now, but where the exact time isn't important.**

To form the Present Perfect tense, use **have or has followed by the past participle of the verb**.

The past participle of the verb see is seen. It's **irregular**, which means it doesn't just **add -ed** like regular verbs. 

For example:

`I have seen the report.` -> At some point before now, you saw the report.

`She has seen the report.` -> At some point before now, she saw the report.


- In the Present Perfect tense, **contractions often combine the subject and the auxiliary verb have or has**. 

For example: `They have` becomes `They've`. / `He has` becomes `He's`.


### Present Perfect - Questions


The Present Perfect tense is often used to ask about experiences or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past.

When forming questions in this tense, use **Have or Has (auxiliary verb) + subject + past participle (main verb)**. 

For example:

`Have you ever been to the HR?` -> Asking if someone has visited the HR at any time in the past.

`Has it finished loading the update?` -> Asking if the process of loading the update was completed at some point in the past.


### Present Perfect - Short answers


When answering to a yes/no question in the Present Perfect tense, you can use short answers:


For a positive answer, you would say `Yes, we have`. This confirms that the action has been done before.

For a negative answer, you would say `No, we haven't`. This clearly indicates that the action has not been done before.

### Present Perfect Conitnuous

The Present Perfect Continuous tense is used to **describe actions that started in the past and are still continuing or have recently stopped, often with an emphasis on the duration of the action**.

It is formed using **have/has been + the present participle (verb ending in -ing)**.

Example: `The navigation bar and the footer haven't been adapting well to smaller screens.`
