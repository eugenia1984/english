```
James: Have you seen the latest user feedback?
        They've mentioned some elements of our homepage aren't displaying correctly on mobile devices.
Linda: Yes, I've reviewed the reports.
       It seems we've got a UI display issue across different screen sizes.
James: Have we fixed anything like this before?
Linda: No, we haven't, but we've solved similar issues on other projects.
James: Have you had the time to identify which elements are causing the trouble?
Linda: Yes, I have.
       The navigation bar and the footer haven't been adapting well to smaller screens.
James: Have we received any detailed reports from users about this issue?
Linda: Yes, a few actually.
       They've emailed us screenshots showing how elements overlap on their devices.
James: Alright, what's our next step?
       Has the development team been informed about this?
Linda: Not yet, but I've scheduled a meeting for tomorrow morning.
       We'll go over the proposed fixes and decide on the best approach.

### Present Perfect

The Present Perfect tense is used **to talk about actions or experiences that happened at some point before now.**

Use this structure **to talk about something that happened before now, but where the exact time isn't important.**

To form the Present Perfect tense, use **have or has followed by the past participle of the verb**.

The past participle of the verb see is seen. It's **irregular**, which means it doesn't just **add -ed** like regular verbs. 

For example:

`I have seen the report.` -> At some point before now, you saw the report.

`She has seen the report.` -> At some point before now, she saw the report.


- In the Present Perfect tense, **contractions often combine the subject and the auxiliary verb have or has**. 

For example: `They have` becomes `They've`. / `He has` becomes `He's`.


### Present Perfect - Questions


The Present Perfect tense is often used to ask about experiences or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past.

When forming questions in this tense, use **Have or Has (auxiliary verb) + subject + past participle (main verb)**. 

For example:

`Have you ever been to the HR?` -> Asking if someone has visited the HR at any time in the past.

`Has it finished loading the update?` -> Asking if the process of loading the update was completed at some point in the past.

`Have you finished your project?`

### Present Perfect - Short answers


When answering to a yes/no question in the Present Perfect tense, you can use short answers:


For a positive answer, you would say `Yes, we have`. This confirms that the action has been done before.

For a negative answer, you would say `No, we haven't`. This clearly indicates that the action has not been done before.

### Present Perfect Continuous

The Present Perfect Continuous tense is used to **describe actions that started in the past and are still continuing or have recently stopped, often with an emphasis on the duration of the action**.

It is formed using **have/has been + the present participle (verb ending in -ing)**.

Example: `The navigation bar and the footer haven't been adapting well to smaller screens.`

### Present Perfect - Since

Since is used with the Present Perfect tense **to show when an action or event started in the past and continues to the present**. 

For example: `I have worked here since 2019.` -> This means the action of working started in 2019 and is still true now.

**Use since with a specific point in time (like a year, date, or a specific event)**.

### Present Perfect Continuous - Questions

`Has` is the auxiliary verb used to start a question in the Present Perfect tense for the third person singular.

Example: `Has the development teams know about it?`

```
Bob:   Linda, have you had a chance to review the user feedback since we deployed the update?
Linda: Yes, I've just looked over the responses.
       We've already seen a significant drop in complaints about the UI issue.
Bob:   That's great to hear.
       Are all updated elements performing well across devices?
Linda: Yes, the navigation bar and footer adjustments have already made a big difference,
        but we haven't addressed all the minor elements yet.
Bob:   I was worried about that.
       What do we have to deal with now?
Linda: I've compiled a list.
       We've made progress, but some icons and buttons aren't responding correctly.
Bob:   Have any users specifically mentioned these issues in their feedback?
Linda: Not yet, but I anticipate we'll start receiving more detailed reports
       as more users navigate the updated interface.
Bob:   Alright.
       What's our timeline for these remaining issues?
Linda: I believe we can roll out another update by next month.
       We've already started working on the fixes.
Bob:   Thanks for staying proactive, Linda.
        Let's ensure we keep up this momentum.

```
James:  Linda, looking back,
        how long have we been collaborating on these updates?
Linda:  It's been over a year now.
        We've really come a long way since that first feedback came in.
        I've been part of the design team for three years and
        the changes we've made in just this last year have had a great impact.
James:  Agreed.
        I've learned so much about user interface design in the process.
        Before this, I hadn't focused much on the User Experience aspect of development.
Linda:  That's true.
        You've been integrating UX into your work more than ever before.
James:  It's interesting to think about it.
        I used to just write code without thinking much about the end user,
        but now ensuring a positive User Experience has become a central part of my development process.
Linda:  Exactly.
        And remember when we rolled out that major update last month?
        The feedback we've received has been super positive.
James:  I'm happy to hear that.
        After all, we're proactively enhancing the platform based on what we've learned.
```


### Present Perfect Continuous

**Have been collaborating** is a form of the present perfect continuous tense. It describes an action that started in the past and is still ongoing. 

For example: `We have been collaborating on this project for two years.` -> This means that the collaboration started two years ago and is still happening.


### Preposition FOR

The preposition for is used **to indicate a period of time in this context**. When combined with the Present Perfect tense (have been), it shows how long something has lasted up to the present. 

For example:

`She has worked here for five years`. -> She started working there five years ago and is still working there now.
