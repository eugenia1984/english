```
Jessica: Hi, Mark.
         We need to talk about security protocols for the new project.
         There are a few things you must do to ensure compliance.
Mark:    Sure, Jessica.
         What do I need to do?
Jessica: First,
         you must update your software tools to the latest versions.
         This is crucial for maintaining security.
Mark:    Okay, I can do that.
         Is there anything else I need to be aware of?
Jessica: Yes, you have to set up
         multi factor authentication for all user accounts.
         It's mandatory for this project.
Mark:    Got it.
         Does that apply to the development team as well?
Jessica: Yes,
         everyone must use multi factor authentication,
         including QA.
         It's a non negotiable requirement.
Mark:    Understood.
         I'll make sure to update the team.
         By the way,
         do we have to follow any specific guidelines
         for data encryption?
Jessica: Yes,
         all sensitive data must be encrypted,
         and you have to ensure
         that the encryption keys are stored securely.
         This is essential for preventing data breaches.
Mark:    Okay, thanks for letting me know.
         I'll handle it.
         Is there anything else I need to do?
Jessica: Besides that,
         you should run regular security audits.
         It's not mandatory,
         but it's a good idea to catch vulnerabilities early.
Mark:    Sounds like a plan.
         I'll start with the updates
         and set up the authentication.
         Thanks for the guidance, Jessica.
Jessica: No problem, Mark.
         Let me know
         if you need any help or have more questions.

### Need to

Need to is used when something is necessary. For example:

`You need to save your work before closing the program`. -> It is important to save the file so you don't lose your work.

`The team needs to finish the project by Friday`. -> The team must complete the project before the deadline.

Jessica mentions security protocols for the new project, meaning she wants to discuss measures to keep the project safe.

### Must, Have to, Should

- **Must** expresses strong necessity or obligation. For example: `You must wear a seatbelt..

- **Have to** also expresses obligation but is sometimes less strict than must. For example: `You have to submit the report by Friday..

- **Should** is used for recommendations or advice. For example: `You should review your notes before the test..

```
Sophie: Hi, James.
        We're discussing some of the possible outcomes
        of our next software release.
        I have a few questions about what might happen
        if we run into issues.
        Can you help me understand the possibilities?
James:  Sure, Sophie.
        What do you want to know?
Sophie: Well,
        I'm concerned about the deployment process.
        It could go smoothly,
        or we might face some bugs.
        What do you think is most likely?
James:  It's hard to say.
        We could have a smooth deployment,
        but there's always a chance that a few bugs might pop up.
        It depends on how well we've tested everything.
Sophie: That makes sense.
        If we find bugs during deployment,
        what would be the immediate response?
James:  If we find critical bugs,
        we'll probably have to roll back the deployment
        and fix them before trying again.
        It might delay the release,
        but it's better than having a broken product.
Sophie: I agree.
        Another thing I'm curious about is performance.
        Do you think our servers might struggle
        with high traffic after the release?
James:  It's possible.
        If we get a lot of users at once,
        the servers could get overwhelmed.
        We may need to scale up to handle the load.
Sophie: Thanks for the insight.
        It sounds like we need to prepare for different scenarios.
```

### Might, May, Can, Could

- **May** expresses possibility or permission. For example: `May I use your phone?

- **Might** indicates a smaller possibility than may, often used for less certain situations. For example: `She might come to the meeting.

- **Can** expresses ability or permission. For example: `Can I leave early?

- **Could** is used for past ability, polite requests, or a less certain possibility than can. For example: `Could you help me?

```
Jake:  Lisa, we've had a security breach
       in our internal network.
       We need to find out how this happened.
       Can you help me investigate it?
Lisa:  Sure, Jake.
       Do we know when the breach occurred?
Jake:  It must have happened last night
       because that's when we started
       noticing unusual activity on the servers.
       What I can't figure out
       is how they got past our firewall.
Lisa;  That's strange.
       Our firewall settings are usually solid.
       It must have been something else.
       Could someone have left a port open?
Jake:  It's possible.
       I was checking the logs
       and there was a lot of traffic
       from one particular IP address.
       It might have been a targeted attack.
Lisa;  If it was a targeted attack,
       we need to find out what they accessed.
       Have you checked which files were compromised?
Jake:  Not yet,
       but we should focus on the critical systems first.
       It can't be just a random breach.
       There must be a specific reason they targeted us.
Lisa;  Agreed.
       We should probably isolate the affected systems
       and run a full scan.
       This will help us understand
       the extent of the breach and what they might have taken.
Jake:  Good idea.
       I'll start working on it.
       We should also notify the security team
       and follow our incident response plan.
Lisa;  Absolutely.
       I'll work on isolating the systems
       and keep you updated.
       Let me know if you find anything unusual.
Jake:  Will do.
       Thanks for your help, Lisa.
Lisa:  No problem, Jake.
       We have to get to the bottom of this. 
```

### Can not (Can't)

The contraction **can't** is short for **cannot**, which means **not able to do something**.

**Can't (cannot) + base verb** -> is used when something is impossible or difficult to understand. 

For example:

`I can't believe this happened!` -> It is hard for you to believe.

`She can't access the system`. -> She is not able to.

 ### Must have been

**Must have been** is used **to express a strong logical conclusion about the past**. 

For example: `She is tired. She must have been working all day`. -> You're confident she worked all day because she looks exhausted.
