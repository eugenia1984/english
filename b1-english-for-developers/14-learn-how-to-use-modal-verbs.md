```
Jessica: Hi, Mark.
         We need to talk about security protocols for the new project.
         There are a few things you must do to ensure compliance.
Mark:    Sure, Jessica.
         What do I need to do?
Jessica: First,
         you must update your software tools to the latest versions.
         This is crucial for maintaining security.
Mark:    Okay, I can do that.
         Is there anything else I need to be aware of?
Jessica: Yes, you have to set up
         multi factor authentication for all user accounts.
         It's mandatory for this project.
Mark:    Got it.
         Does that apply to the development team as well?
Jessica: Yes,
         everyone must use multi factor authentication,
         including QA.
         It's a non negotiable requirement.
Mark:    Understood.
         I'll make sure to update the team.
         By the way,
         do we have to follow any specific guidelines
         for data encryption?
Jessica: Yes,
         all sensitive data must be encrypted,
         and you have to ensure
         that the encryption keys are stored securely.
         This is essential for preventing data breaches.
Mark:    Okay, thanks for letting me know.
         I'll handle it.
         Is there anything else I need to do?
Jessica: Besides that,
         you should run regular security audits.
         It's not mandatory,
         but it's a good idea to catch vulnerabilities early.
Mark:    Sounds like a plan.
         I'll start with the updates
         and set up the authentication.
         Thanks for the guidance, Jessica.
Jessica: No problem, Mark.
         Let me know
         if you need any help or have more questions.

### Need to

Need to is used when something is necessary. For example:

`You need to save your work before closing the program`. -> It is important to save the file so you don't lose your work.

`The team needs to finish the project by Friday`. -> The team must complete the project before the deadline.

Jessica mentions security protocols for the new project, meaning she wants to discuss measures to keep the project safe.

### Must, Have to, Should

- **Must** expresses strong necessity or obligation. For example: `You must wear a seatbelt..

- **Have to** also expresses obligation but is sometimes less strict than must. For example: `You have to submit the report by Friday..

- **Should** is used for recommendations or advice. For example: `You should review your notes before the test..
