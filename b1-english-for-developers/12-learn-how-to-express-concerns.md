```
Bob:    Hey Maria, can we talk about the project timeline?      
        The client is asking if we can finish a week earlier.
        What do you think?
Maria:  A week earlier?
        That's quite a tight squeeze, Bob.
        The team is already working hard.
Bob:    I know, but I'm wondering
        if there's anything we could do to speed things up.
        Maybe move some tasks around
        or prioritize the most important ones?
Maria:  That might help,
        but we need to be careful not to burn out the team.
        They're already putting in extra hours.
        Besides, rearranging tasks doesn't always solve the problem.
Bob:    True,
        but we could try working even more extra hours just for this project.
        Wouldn't that make a difference?
Maria:  It might, but it's not ideal.
        We should consider the long-term impact
        on the team's morale and productivity.
        Have you thought about getting additional support?
Bob:    That's a good idea,
        but I'm not sure we have the budget for that.
        We might need to stick with what we have for now.
Maria:  Understood.
        In that case, let's at least prioritize the tasks.
        If we can focus on the critical parts of the project,
        we might still meet the deadline without overworking everyone.
Bob:    That sounds like a plan.
        Could you draft a new schedule based on this idea?
        Also, could you check with the team
        to see what they need to make things work more smoothly?
Maria:  Sure.
        I'll work on it today
        and send you the new schedule by tomorrow.
        I'll also ask the team
        if they have any suggestions or need additional resources.
Bob:    Great.
        Thanks. I appreciate it, Maria.
        If you need anything from me, just let me know.

### Adjective followed by an infinitive - negative form

When using an adjective followed by an infinitive, the negative form is made by adding not to before the verb. For example:

Affirmative: `She was happy to help with the project`. -> This means helping with the project made her happy.

Negative: `He was careful not to forget the deadline`. -> This means he made sure he remembered it.

```
Maria:  Hey James,
        can we talk about my latest meeting with Bob?
        I need to understand
        how the team feels about the new project deadline.
James:  Sure, Maria.
        What did he say about it?
Maria:  Bob mentioned that the client wants us
        to finish the project a week earlier.
        How do you think they will feel about that?
James:  Honestly, they're pretty stressed.
        We've already been putting in extra hours
        and this new deadline isn't helping.
        It's like there's always more to do.
Maria:  I hear you.
        This extra workload could lead to burnout.
        Wouldn't it be better
        if we prioritized the tasks differently to reduce stress?
James:  That might help,
        but we also need more hands on deck.
        We're short on a few key roles
        and it's making things difficult for everyone.
Maria:  I understand.
        I've talked to Bob about this,
        but I don't think it's an option.
        I'll bring it up again and see if I can convince him.
        Besides that,
        are there other issues I should know about?
James:  Yes.
        Communication has been a challenge.
        Sometimes we get updates too late
        and it affects our work.
        It'd be great if we had more regular check-ins.
Maria:  That's a good point.
        I'll suggest having more regular check-ins
        with the team to improve communication.
        Would that help?
JameS:  Yes, that would be great.
        Thanks for listening, Maria.
Maria:  No problem, James.
        I'll take this feedback to Bob.
        Let's work together to find a way to manage the stress.

```
Bob:   Hi, Maria.
       I heard there was some tension in the last team meeting.
       Can we talk about it?
Maria: Sure, Bob.
       It's about the new deadline.
       The team is really worried it's too tight.
       They're feeling quite overwhelmed with the extra workload.
Bob:   I see.
       Did they mention why they think it's too tight?
Maria: Yes,
       they said they're already putting in extra hours.
       If we add more tasks,
       it could lead to burnout.
Bob:   So did they say how we could fix it?
Maria: They mentioned a couple of things.
       First, they really need more support.
       We're quite short on a few roles,
       which makes it really hard to meet the new deadline.
Bob:   Okay.
       Is there anything else we should consider?
Maria: They also said the communication isn't great
       because they often don't hear about changes until it's too late.
       It'd be helpful if we had more regular check-ins.
Bob:   That makes sense.
       Could you set up a weekly meeting
       to discuss progress and keep everyone in the loop?
       It might help reduce stress and avoid misunderstandings.
Maria: Sure, I can do that.
       But to really ease the pressure,
       we might need to adjust the deadline
       even if it's just a few days.
       This would give the team some breathing room.
Bob:   I'll look into it.
       Could you also find out how much extra time they really need?
Maria: Sure.
       I'll talk to the team
       and let you know what they say.
       Let's also plan a meeting to discuss resources with HR.
