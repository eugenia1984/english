```
Mark:   Hey Sophie.
        Thanks for letting me sit in on the code review.
        I heard some terms that were new to me.
        Can I ask you about a few of them?
Sophie: Sure Mark.
        What's on your mind?
Mark:   Well, you mentioned polymorphism.
        I think it means a code structure
        that can have multiple shapes or forms.
        Is that right?
Sophie: Kind of.
        Polymorphism refers to a function or object
        that can behave differently depending on the context.
        It's not just about having different shapes,
        but about being flexible in how it operates.
Mark:   Oh, okay. Thanks for explaining.
        I also heard encapsulation.
        Does that mean breaking code into smaller parts
        like encapsulating it?
Sophie: Not quite.
        Encapsulation is about keeping some details hidden
        to make the code easier to work with.
        Think of it as wrapping code
        to limit what other parts can see.
Mark:   Got it.
        And what about inheritance?
        Does this mean passing down code
        from one project to another?
Sophie: Not exactly.
        Inheritance is when one class
        inherits properties and methods from another class,
        allowing for code reuse
        and extending functionality within a project.
Mark:   Thanks for clarifying.
        And abstraction.
        Does it mean simplifying complex systems
        by hiding unnecessary details?
Sophie: Yes, that's correct.
        Abstraction is about reducing complexity
        by showing only what's necessary,
        keeping the details hidden.
Mark:   At least I got one right.
        I think I'm starting to understand these terms better.
        Thanks for the explanation, Sophie.

```
Mark:  Hey, Lisa.
       I need your help with something.
       There's a strange issue with the software,
       but I'm not sure how to describe it.
       Can you take a look?
Lisa:  Sure, Mark.
       What's going on?
Mark:  Well, when I click on the menu,
       it sometimes disappears or shows the wrong options.
       It's like it's glitching or something.
       Does that make sense?
Lisa:  I think so.
       It could be a rendering problem.
       Does it happen every time you click or just sometimes?
