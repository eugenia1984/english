```
Jessica:  Hey Brian,
          I heard we're running some tests on the website this weekend.
          Are you going to be online during the scheduled maintenance?
Brian:    Yes, I'll be monitoring the system to make sure everything goes smoothly.
          We've been preparing for it all week.
          Are you planning to join us?
Jessica:  Yes, I will be joining you.
          I want to double-check the new security features
          to prevent any potential denial of service attacks.
          When do we expect the maintenance to start?
Brian:    It's going to start around 2 a.m. and should last a couple of hours.
          We'll be testing the server load to ensure it's stable.
Jessica:  Sounds good.
          Are the other developers going to help you with the tests?
Brian:    Yes, they're going to run additional stress tests
          to ensure that we don't have any unexpected issues.
          Do you think we'll need to update the users about the downtime?
Jessica:  Yes, I'll send out a notification to our users
          letting them know about the maintenance window.
          It's better to inform them in advance.
Brian:    Good idea.
          We don't want anyone getting frustrated because they can't access the site.

### Future Continuous

The Future Continuous tense is used to describe an ongoing action that will happen in the future. 

Its structure is **will be + verb ending in -ing**.

I will be double-checking the new security features tomorrow.
