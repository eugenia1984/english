```
Jessica:  Hey Brian,
          I heard we're running some tests on the website this weekend.
          Are you going to be online during the scheduled maintenance?
Brian:    Yes, I'll be monitoring the system to make sure everything goes smoothly.
          We've been preparing for it all week.
          Are you planning to join us?
Jessica:  Yes, I will be joining you.
          I want to double-check the new security features
          to prevent any potential denial of service attacks.
          When do we expect the maintenance to start?
Brian:    It's going to start around 2 a.m. and should last a couple of hours.
          We'll be testing the server load to ensure it's stable.
Jessica:  Sounds good.
          Are the other developers going to help you with the tests?
Brian:    Yes, they're going to run additional stress tests
          to ensure that we don't have any unexpected issues.
          Do you think we'll need to update the users about the downtime?
Jessica:  Yes, I'll send out a notification to our users
          letting them know about the maintenance window.
          It's better to inform them in advance.
Brian:    Good idea.
          We don't want anyone getting frustrated because they can't access the site.
```

### Future Continuous

The Future Continuous tense is used to describe an ongoing action that will happen in the future. 

Its structure is **will be + verb ending in -ing**.

I will be double-checking the new security features tomorrow.

```
Alice: Hey, Mark.
       We've been having some trouble with our user authentication,
       haven't we?
Mark:  Yes, we have.
       Some users are complaining that they can't log in.
       Did you figure out what's causing the problem?
Alice: I think it's related to our session manager.
       The tokens aren't being refreshed properly, are they?
Mark:  That seems to be the case.
       The system is supposed to renew tokens every 30 minutes, isn't it?
Alice: Yes, it should, but something's going wrong.
       Are you going to check the server logs to find out what happened?
Mark:  I already did.
       There's nothing unusual in the logs.
       This is strange, isn't it?
Alice: It is.
       Let's run a few more tests to see if we can replicate the issue.
       Will you help me with that?
Mark:  Sure.
       We can do some tests on the staging server, can't we?
Alice: Yes, we can.
       That should give us more information.
       By the way, have the support tickets been piling up because of this?
Mark:  Unfortunately, yes.
       We need to resolve this quickly, don't we?
Alice: Absolutely.
       Let's work together to find a solution.
       We don't want our users getting frustrated, do we?
Mark:  No, we don't.
       Okay, let's get to work and see if we can sort this out.
```

### Question tags

Tag questions are **short questions added to the end of a sentence**. They are used **to confirm information or ask for agreement**. 

A tag question includes a helping verb and a pronoun that matches the subject of the main sentence. The verb in the tag question must match the verb tense of the main sentence.

- `Haven't` and `hasn't` are negative contractions of `have` and `has`, used in tag questions to confirm or check information.

-Use haven't when the subject is plural (like we or they) or when the subject is I. 

-Use hasn't when the subject is singular (like he, she, or it). For example:

`We've been working hard, haven't we?` -> The main sentence uses we've (we have), so the tag question uses haven't we? to confirm the statement.

`She's finished her report, hasn't she?` -> The main sentence uses she's (she has), so the tag question uses hasn't she? to confirm the statement.
