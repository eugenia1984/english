```
Sophie: Hey Mark,
        I was reviewing your latest code submission,
        and I noticed a small error in the loop structure.
        It's not a big deal,
        but we should fix it before it causes problems.
        Can we talk about it?
Mark:   Sure, Sophie.
        What did I do wrong?
Sophie: You used a simple for loop,
        but given our use case,
        you should have used a while loop instead.
        The for loop might not account for all the edge cases,
        which could lead to unexpected behavior.
Mark:   Oh, I see.
        I should have checked the requirements more carefully.
        Thanks for pointing that out.
Sophie: No problem.
        You should also remember to use comments in your code.
        It makes it easier for others to understand what you're doing.
        You could have added a comment
        explaining why you chose a particular loop structure.
Mark:   Got it.
        I should have been more thorough in my comments.
        I'll fix that
        and make sure that I use a while loop next time.
Sophie: Great.
        Also, you should have run the test suite
        before submitting your code.
        It would have caught the error early on
        and saved you some time.
        Did you run the tests?
Mark:   No, I didn't.
        I should have, but I was in a hurry.
        I guess I should make it a habit to run the tests every time.
Sophie: Absolutely.
        It's a good practice and it helps avoid mistakes.
        Don't worry though.
        We all mess up sometimes.
        We all learn from our mistakes.
Mark:   Thanks, Sophie.
        I appreciate your feedback.
        I'll correct the code and run the tests.
        If there's anything else I should do,
        let me know.
Sophie: Will do.
        Just remember to take your time
        and double check your work.
        It's better to be thorough
        than to rush and miss something.
