```
Sarah:   Hey Mark,
         have you noticed that some computers aren't booting properly?
Mark:    Yes, I have.
         If the power cable isn't connected securely,
         the computer won't turn on.
         Did you check that?
Sarah:   I did,
         but the problem seems to be more than just the power connection.
         Have you seen anything similar?
Mark:    Sometimes if the BIOS is corrupted,
         it prevents the computer from starting.
         If that's the case, it can be tricky to fix.
Sarah:   Yeah, it can.
         Speaking of which,
         another thing we can check is if the hard drive is failing.
         If it's not functioning,
         the operating system won't load, will it?
Mark:    Right, it won't.
         And if there's a software crash,
         it can be because of incompatible drivers or outdated software.
         Have you updated the drivers recently?
Sarah:   Not yet.
         I was thinking about updating them this week.
         What else could cause software to crash?
Mark:    If the application has memory leaks,
         it can lead to crashes.
         If you notice the system slowing down or freezing,
         that's a sign.
Sarah:   Absolutely.
         Thanks for the insights, Mark.

## Present Continuous

The Present Continuous tense often **emphasizes a temporary condition or an issue occurring at the moment of speaking**. 

For example:

`The server isn't running diagnostics`. -> Highlights that the diagnostics process isn't happening right now.

`Developers aren't debugging the application`. -> Shows the developers aren't working on that activity at the moment.

## Present Simple

The Present Simple tense often **refers to actions or situations that are true all the time, rather than temporary occurrences**. 

For example:

`The system updates automatically every night`. -> Refers to a scheduled routine that happens regularly.

`The app saves data to the cloud`. -> States a general fact about the app's functionality.

## Conditional type 1

`IF PRESENT SIMPLE + FUTURE WITH WILL` -> **This structure is used to talk about real and possible future situations.**

Example: **If** the power cable isn't connected securely, the computer **won't** turn on. 

-> This highlights the importance of a stable, permanent connection for the computer to work, and the Present Simple tense emphasizes the ongoing state of the cable needing to be securely attached.
