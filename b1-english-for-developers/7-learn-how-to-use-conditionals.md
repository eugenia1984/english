## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/28/great-britain.png" alt="great britain"/> If it doesn't boot


```
Sarah:   Hey Mark,
         have you noticed that some computers aren't booting properly?
Mark:    Yes, I have.
         If the power cable isn't connected securely,
         the computer won't turn on.
         Did you check that?
Sarah:   I did,
         but the problem seems to be more than just the power connection.
         Have you seen anything similar?
Mark:    Sometimes if the BIOS is corrupted,
         it prevents the computer from starting.
         If that's the case, it can be tricky to fix.
Sarah:   Yeah, it can.
         Speaking of which,
         another thing we can check is if the hard drive is failing.
         If it's not functioning,
         the operating system won't load, will it?
Mark:    Right, it won't.
         And if there's a software crash,
         it can be because of incompatible drivers or outdated software.
         Have you updated the drivers recently?
Sarah:   Not yet.
         I was thinking about updating them this week.
         What else could cause software to crash?
Mark:    If the application has memory leaks,
         it can lead to crashes.
         If you notice the system slowing down or freezing,
         that's a sign.
Sarah:   Absolutely.
         Thanks for the insights, Mark.

## Present Continuous

The Present Continuous tense often **emphasizes a temporary condition or an issue occurring at the moment of speaking**. 

For example:

`The server isn't running diagnostics`. -> Highlights that the diagnostics process isn't happening right now.

`Developers aren't debugging the application`. -> Shows the developers aren't working on that activity at the moment.

## Present Simple

The Present Simple tense often **refers to actions or situations that are true all the time, rather than temporary occurrences**. 

For example:

`The system updates automatically every night`. -> Refers to a scheduled routine that happens regularly.

`The app saves data to the cloud`. -> States a general fact about the app's functionality.

## Zero Conditional

The Zero Conditional is used **for things that are always true when a condition is met**.

It follows the structure `IF PRESENT SIMPLE (condition) + PRESENT SIMPLE (result)`. 

For example:

`If you press the power button, the computer starts`. -> Pressing the power button always turns on the computer.

`If the internet is down, the website doesn't load`. -> The website won't open if there's no internet connection.



## First Conditional 

The First Conditional is used **to describe a possible situation in the present or future**. 

It follows the structure:  `IF PRESENT SIMPLE (condition) + FUTURE WITH WILL (result)` 

**This structure is used to talk about real and possible future situations.**

Examples: 

**If** the power cable **isn't** connected securely, the computer **won't turn on**.  -> This highlights the importance of a stable, permanent connection for the computer to work, and the Present Simple tense emphasizes the ongoing state of the cable needing to be securely attached.

**If** you **restart** the system, the problem **will go away**. -> Restarting the system will likely resolve the issue.

```
Bob:    Hi Maria,
        have you checked our data backup procedures recently?
        If we don't backup regularly,
        we could lose important information, right?
Maria:  Yes, you're correct.
        If someone forgets, it could be a disaster.
        But I think we are pretty solid here.
        Brian helped us set up a reminder to backup our work daily
        along with some other tasks.
Bob:    Oh, I see.
        So you don't need to rely on your memory.
        That's clever.
Maria:  I agree.
        But why did you ask?
        Did you notice something wrong?
Bob:    No, not really.
        I was in a meeting where the stakeholders were talking about it,
        and I just wanted to double check.
        If we lose critical data, it could set us back weeks.
        Is there anything else we could do besides these reminders?
Maria:  Besides the daily reminders,
        we could also set up automatic backups.
        If we automate the process, there's less chance of human error.
        What do you think?
Bob:    I think that's a great idea.
        If we automate it, we don't have to worry about people forgetting.
        How can we set it up?
Maria:  Brian mentioned we can schedule automatic backups at the end of each day.
        If we do that, it should cover most of our bases.

```
Lisa:  Hey Tom, have you ever thought about
       what would happen if TechCorp went out of business?
Tom:   If TechCorp went out of business,
       it would be a big shock.
       They work with so many companies.
       Why do you ask?
lisa:  I read they might be having money problems.
       If they closed,
       it would affect a lot of tech companies,
       wouldn't it?
Tom:   Yes, it would.
       If they shut down,
       a lot of people would lose their jobs and their current projects would stop,
       wouldn't they?
Lisa:  That's right.
       If that happened,
       a lot of smaller companies would be in trouble too.
       TechCorp helps fund some of their projects.
Tom:   True.
       If that money goes away, those companies might not survive.
       It would be a big change for everyone.
Lisa:  Do you think they can fix their money problems?
Tom:   Maybe, but it's hard to know.
       If they get new investors, it might help,
       but it doesn't look likely.
Lisa:  I hope they do.
       If they go out of business, it would change everything.
Tom:   It definitely would.
        Let's watch the news and see what happens.
```

### Second Conditional:

The Second Conditional structure: **If + Past Simple tense, would + base verb**

This structure is used **for unreal or unlikely scenarios**.

Example:  `What would happen if TechCorp went out of business?`, reflects an imagined possibility.

**If TechCorp went out of business** -> is the condition (imaginary scenario).

**What would happen**  -> expresses the result of that scenario.
