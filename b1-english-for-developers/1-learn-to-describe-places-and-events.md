### Do you have a minute?

`Do you have a minute?`->  is a polite way to ask if someone has time to talk.

The auxiliary verb **do** is used to **form questions** in the **Present Simple tense**.

For example, in the question Do you have a minute?, do is used to ask if someone has time.

### What's up?

`What's up?` is a casual way to ask someone how they are or what they need. It is a common informal greeting or way to start a conversation.

### Is that right?

`Is that right?+ -> is used to confirm information you have heard. It is a common way to ask for confirmation. For example:

If someone says, I'm starting a new job next week, you can reply, Is that right? to confirm what they said.

### Plan to work on

`Plan to work on+ -> means to have an intention or a decision to start or continue working on something. It's used to talk about future actions or projects you intend to do.

When you say that you work on something it means you are dedicating time and energy to a specific task or project. For example:

- `I need to work on my presentation for tomorrow.` -> You need to dedicate time to prepare your presentation for the next day.

- `She plans to work on her novel this summer.` -> She intends to spend time writing or improving her novel during the summer.


### Who's ...?

`Who's`-> is a contraction of who is and is used to ask about a person or people in the Present Simple tense. For example:

`Who's your team lead?`-> is the same as Who is your team lead?

### How about...?

**How about** is used **to suggest a time or idea**. The word during is used to specify a time period when something will happen. 

For example:

`How about we meet at 3 PM?` -> This suggests a meeting time.

`I will call you during the break.` -> This specifies that the call will happen within the break time.

## Dialogue 2: Cybersecurity Training


```
Anna:    Hi, Brian. Do you have a moment?
         I want to talk to you about our cybersecurity training.
Brian:   Sure Anna. Wht's on your mind?
Anna:    It concerns me that some employees might not be using strong passwords.
         Do we cover this in our training?
Brian:   We touch on it, but perhaps not in enough detail.
         I'm currently adding a new section focused on password security now.
Anna:    Sounds good. How often do we hold these training sessions?
Brian:   We have them quarterly, but I'm planning an extra session next month because of recent security threats.
         Yes, it's mandatory.
Anna:    Yes, it's mandatory. And how long are this sessions?
Brian:   Usually two hours.
         I'm thinking of using real life scenarios this time, especially for identifying phishing attempts.
         What do you think?
Anna:    Using real life scenarios makes the training more relevant.
         When do you think this new module will be ready?
Brian:   I'm aiming to have it ready to roll out by the end of the week.
         The team is working on it as we speak.
Anna:    That's great to hear.
         I appreciate your proactive approach to this, Brian.
         Let's touch base again once the module is ready.
```

#@# What's on your mind?

`What's on your mind?` is used to ask someone what they are thinking about or what they want to discuss. For example: `You look worried. What's on your mind?`


##@ How often?

**How often** is used **to ask about the frequency of an event**. 

For example:

`How often do you update the software?` -> You are asking about the number of times the software is updated in a given period.

`How often does the team meet?` -> You are asking about the frequency of team meetings.

### To hold

**To hold** can mean to **organize or conduct an event**. It is often used when talking about meetings, classes, or events. 

For example:

`We hold sprint meetings every Monday.` -> You and your team organize sprint meetings every Monday.

`They hold a tech webinar every quarter.` -> They organize a tech webinar once every three months.

### Extra 

**Extra** means **additional or more than what is usual or necessary**. 

For example:

`We need extra chairs for the meeting.` -> We need more chairs than usual.

### Because

**Because** is used **to give a reason for something**. 

For example:

`We canceled the meeting because of bad weather.` -> The bad weather is the reason for canceling the meeting.

### Recent

**Recent** refers to **something that happened not long ago**. 

For example:

`The recent news was surprising.` -> The news came out not long ago.

### Threat

**Threat** means **a danger or something that can cause harm**. 

For example:

`The virus is a threat to our system.` -> This means the virus could cause harm to the system.

### Real-life scenario


A real-life scenario is a situation that could happen in everyday life. It's used in training or teaching to make the learning more practical and relevant. 

For example:

`The training included real-life scenarios to help us understand how to respond to emergencies`. -> The training used examples of situations that could happen in real life to help participants learn.

### The subject of the sentence

When a sentence starts with a verb that ends in -ing, it often functions as the subject of the sentence. This form is known as a gerund. For example:

Coding is an essential skill for developers. - Coding is the subject of the sentence.

Testing new software helps prevent bugs. - Testing is the subject.


### To roll out

To roll out means **to launch or introduce something new, such as a product, service, or project**. It is often used in business and technology contexts. 

For example:

`The company plans to roll out a new software update next month.` -> The company will launch the update next month.

## Dialogue 3: Struggling with IDEs

```
Tom:   Hey Sarah, do you have a moment?
       I'm struggling with these IDEs.
Sarah: Sure, I'm not busy. What's the problem?
Tom:    The live preview isn't showing in Visual Studio Code.
        Isn't it supposed to support that feature?
Sarah:  It should, but it's not displaying because the live server extension might not be running.
        Are you using that extension for realtime previews?
Tom:    I think we are, but maybe it's not set up right.
        Also, in IntelliJ IDEA, the code autocompletion isn't popping up.
        Isn't it automatic?
Sarah: It usually is, but it doesn't work if the project isn't set up right.
        Have you checked the settings?
Tom:    I'll have to check again.
        And in Eclipse, it's not sho
Sarah:  Yes, they are, but they're not visible if the project isn't linked to Git.
        Is your project connected to Git in Eclipse?
Tom:    It's supposed to be. This is frustrating.
        Are these IDEs always this tricky?
Sarah:  Not always, but they can be when they're not set up properly.
        Do you want to walk through on setting them up?
Tom:     Yes, please. That would be great.
```

### Present Continuous

The Present Continuous tense is used **to describe actions that are happening right now**.

In the example above, notice that when forming the Present Continuous tense with the verb struggle, the final e is dropped, resulting in **struggling**. This is a common rule for verbs that end in e.

In Tom's sentence, he uses the Present Continuous tense to describe his ongoing difficulty with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

You should **add -ing** to struggle because the action is happening right now.

### It

It is used to **replace a noun that has already been mentioned, helping avoid repetition in a sentence**. For example:

`I bought a new laptop. It works really well.` -> Here, it replaces laptop to avoid repeating the word.

`In The Live Preview isn't showing in Visual Studio Code. Isn't it supposed to support that feature?`, it refers to Visual Studio Code because Tom is talking about the program and its ability to support a feature.

It replaces Visual Studio Code to avoid saying the program's name again.

By identifying what is expected to support the feature, you can determine that it refers to the program itself.


### Should

Should is used **to express that something is expected to happen or be true**. 

When Sarah says, It should, she means that the live preview is expected to work in Visual Studio Code. For example:

`The app should start when you press the button.` -> This means you expect the app to start when pressing the button.


### Tag question

A tag question **is a short question added to the end of a sentence to confirm or check something**. It's often used when the speaker expects the listener to agree with them. For example:

`It's a nice day, isn't it?` -> The speaker expects that the listener will agree that it's a nice day.

`They are coming to the meeting, aren't they?` -> The speaker expects that the listener will agree that they are coming to the meeting.

When Tom says, `Isn't it automatic?`, he is asking for confirmation that the auto-completion should happen automatically.

### Present Simple - Negative (doesn't / isn't)


In the Present Simple tense, the negative form is created using **doesn't** or **isn't** for third-person singular subjects (he, she, it).

Use **doesn't** with action verbs to show that something is not happening, like `It doesn't work`.

Use **isn't** with forms of to be to show that something is not true, like `isn't set up`.

### IF

**if** -> often introduces the cause of a problem, explaining what needs to happen for something else to occur.

Example:

| Effect | Cause |
| ------ | ----- |
| The auto-completion doesn't work. |If the project isn't set up correctly. |

### Have you...?

When someone asks a question like **Have you + verb ?**, they are trying to find out if you did something specific.

In this case, Sarah asks: `Have you checked the settings?` because she wants to know if Tom has already taken a specific action that could solve the problem.

#@# Verb to be - question

When forming questions with the verb to be, the usual word order of the subject and verb is inverted. This means that the verb comes before the subject. For example:

Your project is connected to Git. (Statement)

`Is your project connected to Git?` (Question) -> In Sarah's sentence, she uses this inversion to ask Tom if his project is connected to Git in Eclipse.
