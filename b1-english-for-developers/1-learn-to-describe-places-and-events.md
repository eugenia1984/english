## Dialogue 2: Cybersecurity Training


```
Anna:    Hi, Brian. Do you have a moment?
         I want to talk to you about our cybersecurity training.

Anna:    It concerns me that some employees might not be using strong passwords.
         Do we cover this in our training?

         I'm currently adding a new section focused on password security now.
Anna:    Sounds good. How often do we hold these training sessions?

         Yes, it's mandatory.

         When do you think this new module will be ready?

         The team is working on it as we speak.

         I appreciate your proactive approach to this, Brian.
         Let's touch base again once the module is ready.
