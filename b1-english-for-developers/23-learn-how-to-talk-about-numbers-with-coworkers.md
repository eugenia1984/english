```
JessicA: Hey, James. I've been reviewing our project schedule,
         and I think we need to redefine our milestones.
         How many phases do we currently have planned?
James:   Hi, Jessica. We have four major phases.
         For the initial phase,
         the first task is to finalize the software requirements by next Friday.
Jessica: Okay, that's good. For the second phase,
         how many development tasks are we looking at?
James:   We've outlined 10 tasks for development.
         The third task involves setting up the core database,
         and it's crucial since everything else depends on it.
Jessica: Right. Let's make sure we allocate enough time for that.
         By when do you think we can complete the third phase?
James:   If all goes well, we should complete the third phase,
         which includes all initial testing, by the end of April.
Jessica: Perfect. For the final phase,
         we should aim to have at least two weeks for beta testing
         and fixing any critical issues that our testers find.
         What's the last task in that phase?
James:   The last, or 10th, task is to prepare the deployment documentation.
         We should have that ready near the last week of the project.
Jessica: Excellent. I'll update our project timeline with these numbers
         and make sure everyone's clear about the order and deadlines.
         Thanks for the breakdown, James.

### Cardinal number

A cardinal number **tells you "how many" of something there are**. Words like one, two, three, four are all cardinal numbers. 

For example: `We completed two phases of the project`. —> Two tells you the number of phases.

###

- **initial phase**: means the beginning stage of something. For example: `During the initial phase of testing, we found several bugs`. —> This means bugs were found at the start of testing.

- **to finalize**: means to complete or finish something officially. For example: `We need to finalize the design before the meeting`. —> They need to complete the design.

### Ordinal number

Ordinal numbers **tell the position of something in a sequence**, such as steps, tasks, or stages. 

Examples include: first, second, third, fourth, and so on.

To form most ordinal numbers, you take the cardinal number (1, 2, 3, 4...) and add the correct ending. Most ordinal numbers follow the pattern of adding -th, like 4 becomes fourth, and 6 becomes sixth. But 1, 2, and 3 are irregular: 1 becomes first, 2 becomes second, and 3 becomes third.

```
Alice: Good morning, David. Since Maria is at the conference this week,
       I'll be walking you through the budget breakdown for our project phases.
David: Morning, Alice. That sounds good.
       Can you start with how our budget is currently allocated
       across the different phases?
Alice: Absolutely. As of now,
       45% of our total budget has been allocated to the development phase.
       Specifically, one-fourth of this portion is directed towards back-end development,
       which is crucial given our scalability goals.
David: And what about the front-end and design aspects?
Alice: The front-end development and user interface
       design together consume about 27% of the overall budget.
       Half of that is dedicated to user experience enhancements,
       ensuring the interface is intuitive and user-friendly.
David: I see. How are we doing with the testing phase?
Alice: Testing has been allocated 13% of the budget.
       This covers everything from initial unit tests
       to final quality assurance checks before launch.
       We believe investing here is essential to ensure a stable release.
David: What fraction of our resources is still available
       for the front-end development and user interface design?
Alice: We have set aside 15% of the budget as a contingency.
       This should cover any unexpected costs
       during the later stages of the project.
David: That's reassuring.
       Can you tell me how much we've spent to date?
Alice: Up to this point, we've used about 40% of the total budget.
       Most of that was in the initial setup and early development stages.
David: Great. Thanks for the detailed update, Alice.
       It's helpful to see how our resources are being managed.
       Let's keep a close eye on our spending as we move forward.
Alice: Will do, David. I'll make sure to update you regularly
       and adjust our allocations as needed based on our progress.
```

### Percent and percentage

**Eighty-three percent** is the correct way to read **83%**.

-> You always use **percent** (not percentages) after an exact number. What's the difference?

- Use percent after a number: `83% is eighty-three percent.` or `20% is twenty percent.

- Use percentage or percentages in general, not after a number: `Eighty-three percentages is incorrect.` or `We saw an increase in percentages across departments`. is correct (used without a specific number).

### Fractions

Fractions are used to describe parts of a whole.

**One-fourth** (¼) is one part out of four equal parts. Other examples:

`½ = one-half`

`⅓ = one-third`

`¾ = three-fourths`

In Alice's case, `one-fourth of the development budget is spent on back-end development`, which shows how money is divided within a category.

```
Sophie: Hey Tom, we need to go through our software tools inventory today.
        Let's start with the licenses. How many do we currently have in total?
Tom:    We have about 50 licenses right now.
        Most of them, around 30, are allocated to the design team.
Sophie: Okay, and where are these licenses stored?
        I need to update our records.
Tom:    They're mainly on the central server under the Licensed Software folder.
         A few are also in the cloud storage, specifically in the Backup Licenses section.
Sophie:
Tom:
