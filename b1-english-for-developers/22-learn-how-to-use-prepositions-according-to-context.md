```
Anna: Good morning, Bob. Have you seen the layout plan for our new office?
      I need your input on where to place each department.
Bob:  Yes, I've looked at the plans. Let's start with the IT department.
      I think it should be next to the server room for easy access.
Anna: That makes sense. The server room is in the back, right? 
Bob:  Exactly. It's in the back, next to the emergency exit.
      Now, where do you think we should put the HR department?
Anna: HR should be near the entrance.
      It's easier for visitors and new employees to find us.
      How about the space right across from the reception?
Bob:  Sounds good. That's very accessible.
      And the marketing team?
      They need a quiet area, but also want to be close to the sales department.
