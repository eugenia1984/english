```
Anna: Good morning, Bob. Have you seen the layout plan for our new office?
      I need your input on where to place each department.
Bob:  Yes, I've looked at the plans. Let's start with the IT department.
      I think it should be next to the server room for easy access.
Anna: That makes sense. The server room is in the back, right? 
Bob:  Exactly. It's in the back, next to the emergency exit.
      Now, where do you think we should put the HR department?
Anna: HR should be near the entrance.
      It's easier for visitors and new employees to find us.
      How about the space right across from the reception?
Bob:  Sounds good. That's very accessible.
      And the marketing team?
      They need a quiet area, but also want to be close to the sales department.
Anna: There's an area on the left side of the building, right next to the sales office.
      It's a bit isolated from the main walkways, so it should be quieter.
Bob:  Perfect. Let's put them there.
      What about the customer support team?
Anna: Let's place them near the middle of the floor.
      They need to be easily reachable.
      Maybe right behind the conference rooms?
Bob:  That works. They'll be central,
      but the conference rooms will buffer some of the noise.
      Last, where should we set up the break room?
Anna: It should be centrally located so it's equally accessible to everyone.
      How about between the IT department and HR?
      That way, it's just a short walk for most teams. 
Bob:  I agree. That's a convenient spot for everyone.
      Thanks, Anna.
      I'll update the layout draft with these changes
      and send it over to you for your final review.
Anna: Thanks, Bob. I'll look out for that,
      and we can discuss it further if there are any tweaks needed.
