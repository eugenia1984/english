```
Sopie:   Hi, Brian. I just spoke with Jake about
         the security breach we had last week.
         He told me we experienced
         a phishing attack that targeted several team members.
Brian:   That sounds serious. What did Jake say?
Sophie:  He said that the team responded quickly
         once the breach was detected.
         Jake mentioned that they managed
         to isolate the affected systems within minutes,
         which limited the damage.
Brain:   Good to hear they contained it quickly.
         Did Jake give any feedback
         on how we can prevent similar incidents in the future?
Sophie:  Yes, he suggested several steps.
         First, Jake thinks we should update our security training
         to cover more about phishing detection.
         He also said that we need to conduct
         regular security audits more frequently.  
Brian:   That makes sense. Did he mention anything about the team's overall reaction?
Sophie:  He did. Jake said that while the team did well to respond quickly,
         there was some confusion
         about who was responsible for what during the incident.
         He believes better role clarity in our incident response plan could help.  
Brian:   That's an important point.
         We should definitely incorporate that feedback
         into our next training session.
         Can you write up a summary of this discussion?
         I'd like to use it to update our training materials.
Sophie:  Of course. I'll get that done.
         Jake also emphasized the importance
         of maintaining our software updates to prevent vulnerabilities.
         He explained that the breach exploited an outdated system component.
Brian:   Right. Thanks for the update, Sophie.
         I'll make sure we address these points
         in our upcoming workshops.

### Reported Speech

reported speech, which is **when someone repeats what another person said, but not using their exact words**. You usually shift the verb to the past. 

For example:

```
Jake (to Sophie): The team responded quickly once the breach was detected.
Sophie (to Brian, mentioning what Jake said): He said that the team responded quickly once the breach was detected.
```

In the cases when you want to report exactly what the other person said, it is common to only add the speaker's name (or a pronoun) in the beginning, the verb say in the Simple Past (as you are reporting something that was talked about previously), and the word that, followed by the information. 

This is common in spoken and written English to share information from someone else.

```
Linda: Hey, Tom. I've compiled the user feedback
       on our latest website redesign.
       It was quite insightful.
Tom:   Awesome. What were some of the major points?
Linda: Well, the new navigation menu was really appreciated.
       It was mentioned that it's much easier to use.
       Several users noted how the simplified layout
       helped them find information faster.
Tom:   That's good to hear.
       Was there anything that didn't go over well?
Linda: Yes, the color scheme was brought up a few times.
       It seems it was found to be a bit overwhelming by some users.
       They suggested it could be toned down a bit.
Tom:   Interesting. We could look at softer colors then.
       Were the changes in the contact page noticed?
Lida:  They were. The new form was described as very user friendly,
       and the additional contact options were highlighted
       as a great improvement.
       The faster response times were also acknowledged.
Tom:   That's excellent.
       How about the images and graphics we updated?
Linda: The new images were well received,
       but the size of some images was mentioned as being too large,
       which apparently slowed down the page loading for some users.
Tom:   Okay, we need to optimize those images then.
       Let's prepare a list of modifications based on this feedback.
       We should prioritize the color scheme and image sizes for the next update.

```
Lisa: Hey Mark, I've been reviewing the logs from last week's database crash.
      It seems like if we had monitored the system load more closely,
      we could have prevented the overload.
Mark: That's true. The logs showed that the database was receiving 
      an unusually high number of queries before it crashed.
      Had we spread those queries more evenly,
      perhaps the system wouldn't have failed.
Lisa: Exactly. Also, I noticed we hadn't updated
      our database management software in a while.
      If the latest patches had been applied,
      they might have addressed some of the vulnerabilities that were exploited.
Mark: I was thinking the same thing.
      If only we had prioritized the update, we might not have faced this issue.
      It's frustrating that we realized its importance too late.
Lisa: It's a tough lesson, but a valuable one.
      Going forward, how can we ensure this doesn't happen again?
      We need a more proactive maintenance strategy.
