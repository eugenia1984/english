```
Sopie:   Hi, Brian.
         I just spoke with Jake about
         the security breach we had last week.
         He told me we experienced
         a phishing attack that targeted several team members.
Brian:   That sounds serious.
         What did Jake say?
Sophie:  He said that the team responded quickly
         once the breach was detected.
         Jake mentioned that they managed
         to isolate the affected systems within minutes,
         which limited the damage.
Brain:   Good to hear they contained it quickly.
         Did Jake give any feedback
         on how we can prevent similar incidents in the future?
Sophie:  Yes, he suggested several steps.
         First, Jake thinks we should update our security training
         to cover more about phishing detection.
         He also said that we need to conduct
         regular security audits more frequently.  
Brian:   That makes sense.
         Did he mention anything about the team's overall reaction?
Sophie:  He did.
         Jake said that while the team did well to respond quickly,
         there was some confusion
         about who was responsible for what during the incident.
         He believes better role clarity in our incident response plan could help.  
Brian:   That's an important point.
         We should definitely incorporate that feedback
         into our next training session.
         Can you write up a summary of this discussion?
         I'd like to use it to update our training materials.
Sophie:  Of course.
         I'll get that done.
         Jake also emphasized the importance
         of maintaining our software updates to prevent vulnerabilities.
         He explained that the breach exploited an outdated system component.
Brian:   Right.
         Thanks for the update, Sophie.
         I'll make sure we address these points
         in our upcoming workshops.
