```
Bob:    We need to start planning our new mobile app project.
        Let's discuss the timeline.
        I was thinking we should aim to have the initial prototype ready in four weeks.
        Does that sound reasonable?
Linda:  I think that's doable.
        We can work on the design sketches this week
        and then move on to wireframes.
Bob:    Exactly.
        Once we have the wireframes,
        we can start collaborating with the developers to implement the frontend design.
Linda:  Absolutely.
        And I can also prepare some user scenarios
        for testing so we can ensure a smooth user experience.
Bob:    Good idea.
        By the way, we need to allocate tasks among the team.
        I was thinking that you could lead the UX design
        and I'll coordinate with the developers.
        Does that works for you?
Linda:  That's a good plan.
        I'll also keep you updated on the design process
        and we can schedule regular meetings to stay on track.
Bob:    Perfect.
        Let's set a weekly meeting to review our progress.
        Would Friday morning work for you?
Linda:  Sure.
        Friday mornings are great.
        It gives me a chance to review the week's work and plan for the next week.
Bob:    Great.
        I'll send out a meeting invite and share the project timeline with everyone.
        Thanks for your input, Linda.
Linda:  No problem, Bob.
        I'm looking forward to working on this project.

### Sketch, Wireframe and User scenarios

- A **sketch** is a rough drawing used to plan or visualize an idea.

For example: `She made a quick sketch of the website layout before designing it digitally`. –> This means she created a simple drawing before starting the actual design.

- A **wireframe** is a simple outline or blueprint of a digital design, showing structure without details.

For example: `The team created wireframes to plan the website's navigation before adding colors and images`. –> This means they first designed a basic structure before working on the visual details.

- **User scenarios** refers to different situations that describe how users interact with a product to achieve a goal. It helps teams test and improve the user experience.

For example: `We created user scenarios to see how customers navigate the checkout process`. –> This means the team simulated different ways users complete a purchase to identify any issues.

### Look forward to + verb -ing

**Look forward to** means to eagerly anticipate something. It is often used when expressing excitement or positive expectation for an event or action that will happen in the future. It should be followed by a noun or the -ing form of a verb. 

For example:

`I'm looking forward to the meeting`. –> This shows your excitement about the meeting.

`I'm looking forward to seeing you soon`. –> This expresses your eagerness about meeting someone in the future.

Hi team,

I hope you're all doing well.
Our first weekly meeting to review the mobile app project progress
is scheduled for Friday morning at 9:00 AM.
We'll go over the timeline, the prototype status,
and the next steps for the design sketches and wireframes.

As we discussed,
Linda will lead the UX design,
and I'll be the one to coordinate with the developers.
We'll also need to allocate tasks for the next phase,
especially around the front-end design.

I'm excited to hear everyone's updates,
and I'm confident these regular check-ins
will help us stay focused and meet our deadlines.
Looking forward to seeing you all!

Best,

Bob
```
