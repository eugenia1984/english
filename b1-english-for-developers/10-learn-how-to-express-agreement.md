```
Bob:    We need to start planning our new mobile app project.
        Let's discuss the timeline.
        I was thinking we should aim to have the initial prototype ready in four weeks.
        Does that sound reasonable?
Linda:  I think that's doable.
        We can work on the design sketches this week
        and then move on to wireframes.
Bob:    Exactly.
        Once we have the wireframes,
        we can start collaborating with the developers to implement the frontend design.
Linda:  Absolutely.
        And I can also prepare some user scenarios
        for testing so we can ensure a smooth user experience.
Bob:    Good idea.
        By the way, we need to allocate tasks among the team.
        I was thinking that you could lead the UX design
        and I'll coordinate with the developers.
        Is that works for you?
Linda:  That's a good plan.
        I'll also keep you updated on the design process
        and we can schedule regular meetings to stay on track.
Bob:    Perfect.
        Let's set a weekly meeting to review our progress.
        Would Friday morning work for you?
Linda:  Sure.
        Friday mornings are great.
        It gives me a chance to review the week's work and plan for the next week.
Bob:    Great.
        I'll send out a meeting invite and share the project timeline with everyone.
        Thanks for your input, Linda.
Linda:  No problem, Bob.
        I'm looking forward to working on this project.

### Sketch, Wireframe and User scenarios

- A **sketch** is a rough drawing used to plan or visualize an idea.

For example: `She made a quick sketch of the website layout before designing it digitally`. –> This means she created a simple drawing before starting the actual design.

- A **wireframe** is a simple outline or blueprint of a digital design, showing structure without details.

For example: `The team created wireframes to plan the website's navigation before adding colors and images`. –> This means they first designed a basic structure before working on the visual details.

- **User scenarios** refers to different situations that describe how users interact with a product to achieve a goal. It helps teams test and improve the user experience.

For example: `We created user scenarios to see how customers navigate the checkout process`. –> This means the team simulated different ways users complete a purchase to identify any issues.
