```
Bob:    We need to start planning our new mobile app project.
        Let's discuss the timeline.
        I was thinking we should aim to have the initial prototype ready in four weeks.
        Does that sound reasonable?
Linda:  I think that's doable.
        We can work on the design sketches this week
        and then move on to wireframes.
Bob:    Exactly.
        Once we have the wireframes,
        we can start collaborating with the developers to implement the frontend design.
Linda:  Absolutely.
        And I can also prepare some user scenarios
        for testing so we can ensure a smooth user experience.
Bob:    Good idea.
        By the way, we need to allocate tasks among the team.
        I was thinking that you could lead the UX design
        and I'll coordinate with the developers.
        Does that works for you?
Linda:  That's a good plan.
        I'll also keep you updated on the design process
        and we can schedule regular meetings to stay on track.
Bob:    Perfect.
        Let's set a weekly meeting to review our progress.
        Would Friday morning work for you?
Linda:  Sure.
        Friday mornings are great.
        It gives me a chance to review the week's work and plan for the next week.
Bob:    Great.
        I'll send out a meeting invite and share the project timeline with everyone.
        Thanks for your input, Linda.
Linda:  No problem, Bob.
        I'm looking forward to working on this project.

### Sketch, Wireframe and User scenarios

- A **sketch** is a rough drawing used to plan or visualize an idea.

For example: `She made a quick sketch of the website layout before designing it digitally`. –> This means she created a simple drawing before starting the actual design.

- A **wireframe** is a simple outline or blueprint of a digital design, showing structure without details.

For example: `The team created wireframes to plan the website's navigation before adding colors and images`. –> This means they first designed a basic structure before working on the visual details.

- **User scenarios** refers to different situations that describe how users interact with a product to achieve a goal. It helps teams test and improve the user experience.

For example: `We created user scenarios to see how customers navigate the checkout process`. –> This means the team simulated different ways users complete a purchase to identify any issues.

### Look forward to + verb -ing

**Look forward to** means to eagerly anticipate something. It is often used when expressing excitement or positive expectation for an event or action that will happen in the future. It should be followed by a noun or the -ing form of a verb. 

For example:

`I'm looking forward to the meeting`. –> This shows your excitement about the meeting.

`I'm looking forward to seeing you soon`. –> This expresses your eagerness about meeting someone in the future.

Hi team,

I hope you're all doing well.
Our first weekly meeting to review the mobile app project progress
is scheduled for Friday morning at 9:00 AM.
We'll go over the timeline, the prototype status,
and the next steps for the design sketches and wireframes.

As we discussed,
Linda will lead the UX design,
and I'll be the one to coordinate with the developers.
We'll also need to allocate tasks for the next phase,
especially around the front-end design.

I'm excited to hear everyone's updates,
and I'm confident these regular check-ins
will help us stay focused and meet our deadlines.
Looking forward to seeing you all!

Best,

Bob

```
Sarah:  Mark,
        I reviewed your code for the new feature and it's looking good.
        It's well organized and works as expected.
Mark:   Thanks, Sarah.
        I made sure to keep the code clean and easy to read.
Sarah:  That's great.
        Clean code is helpful.
        The comments you added in the code
        really helped the team understand what each part does.
Mark:   I'm glad you think so.
        I find it helps when we need to make changes later on.
Sarah:  Absolutely.
        I also like how you tested the code
        to make sure it doesn't have any errors.
        It makes our work more reliable.
Mark:   Thanks.
        Testing is important to catch problems early.
        Is there anything else you'd like me to improve on?
Sarah:  Yes.
        Let's work on speeding up the database queries.
        It'll make the app run faster.
Mark:   Got it.
        I'll start working on that and let you know when it's ready.
Sarah:  Sounds great.
        Keep up the good work, Mark.
Mark:   Will do.
        Thanks, Sarah.

```
Jim:    Maria, I've reviewed the latest version of the mobile app
        and I'd like to share some feedback.
        Would now be a good time?
Maria:  Sure, Jim.
        I'm eager to hear what you think.
        How's it looking?
Jim:    Overall, I think it's quite user-friendly.
        The design is clean and the navigation is straightforward.
        However,
        I've noticed that the app tends to lag a bit
        when switching between different sections.
        Could we work on that?
Maria:  I understand your point.
        We are aware of the lag
        and we're already addressing it in our next update.
        Thanks for bringing it to our attention.
Jim:    Also,
        I think the color scheme could use a bit more energy.
        It's currently a bit bland,
        especially for a tech-focused app.
        What do you think?
Maria:  I see where you're coming from.
        We've chosen a subtle color palette,
        but maybe adding some brighter tones would help.
        I'll discuss it with the design team
        and see what we can do to make it more vibrant.
Jim:    Great.
        That would be helpful.
        Another thing, the login process seems a bit lengthy.
        It could be quicker,
        especially for returning users.
        Any thoughts on that?
Maria:  That's a valid point.
        We're planning to implement a Remember Me feature,
        which should help speed up the login process.
        I'll make sure it's prioritized for the next release.
Jim:    Excellent.
        I'm glad to hear that.
        I look forward to seeing the changes in the next version.
        Thanks for listening to my feedback.
Maria:  Absolutely, Jim.
        We appreciate your insights.
        It helps us improve.
        If you have any more suggestions,
        feel free to reach out.
