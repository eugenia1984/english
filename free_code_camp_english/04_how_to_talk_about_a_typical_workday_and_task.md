### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Prepositions of time: in/on/at

- The preposition **in** is used for **months, years, centuries, and long periods**. For example, ``We will update the software in July``, ``I started learning coding in 2022``. ``I like to work in the morning``.

- The preposition **on** is used for days and dates. For example: ``Our team meets on Mondays``, ``The coding class is on April 10th``, ``I finished the task on the last day``.

- The preposition **at** is used to specify exact times of the day. For example, ``Our meeting is at 9 AM``, ``I begin coding at 10 AM``, ``We have lunch at 12 PM``.

**AM** and **PM** are used to tell time during the day. 

- **AM** means **the time from midnight to noon** (for example, 8:00 AM is in the morning). 

- **PM** means **the time from noon to midnight** (for example, 6:00 PM is in the evening).

In English, the day is divided into two periods using AM and PM. 

- **AM stands for Ante Meridiem**, which is Latin for **before midday**. It refers to the time **from midnight (12:00 AM) to noon (12:00 PM)**. So, when you say 9:00 AM, it means 9 in the morning.

- **PM stands for Post Meridiem**, which is Latin for **after midday**. It refers to the time **from noon (12:00 PM) to just before midnight (11:59 PM)**. So, when we say 3:00 PM, it means 3 in the afternoon.
