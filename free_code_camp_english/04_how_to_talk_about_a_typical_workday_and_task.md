# DIALOGUE 1

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Prepositions of time: in/on/at

- The preposition **in** is used for **months, years, centuries, and long periods**. For example, ``We will update the software in July``, ``I started learning coding in 2022``. ``I like to work in the morning``.

- The preposition **on** is used for days and dates. For example: ``Our team meets on Mondays``, ``The coding class is on April 10th``, ``I finished the task on the last day``.

- The preposition **at** is used to specify exact times of the day. For example, ``Our meeting is at 9 AM``, ``I begin coding at 10 AM``, ``We have lunch at 12 PM``.

**AM** and **PM** are used to tell time during the day. 

- **AM** means **the time from midnight to noon** (for example, 8:00 AM is in the morning). 

- **PM** means **the time from noon to midnight** (for example, 6:00 PM is in the evening).

In English, the day is divided into two periods using AM and PM. 

- **AM stands for Ante Meridiem**, which is Latin for **before midday**. It refers to the time **from midnight (12:00 AM) to noon (12:00 PM)**. So, when you say 9:00 AM, it means 9 in the morning.

- **PM stands for Post Meridiem**, which is Latin for **after midday**. It refers to the time **from noon (12:00 PM) to just before midnight (11:59 PM)**. So, when we say 3:00 PM, it means 3 in the afternoon.

The word **most** is used to describe the highest degree or largest part of something. It's often used when comparing three or more things or situations. For example, if you have three tasks - Task A, Task B, and Task C, and Task A takes more time than the others, you can say, ``Task A takes the most time``.

Or in the sentence ``I spend most of my time coding``, **most** indicates that coding takes up the largest part of the time compared to other activities.

In the context of Sophie's dialogue, when she says she likes to work on the ``most important`` tasks first, she means she chooses to do the tasks that are the highest in importance compared to the others.

Examples:

- ``The most challenging part of my job is solving complex problems.```

- ``I like to drink coffee the most in the morning.``

**Before** is used to talk about a time earlier than another event or time. It indicates that something happens first. For example, I eat breakfast before I go to work means that eating breakfast happens earlier in time than going to work.

**After** is used to describe something that happens later than another event or time. It indicates the sequence of events where something happens following something else. For example, I go home after work means that going home happens later in time than finishing work.

**Around** is used with time expressions indicates a time close to but not exactly at that point. It suggests flexibility within a short time frame. For example, We'll meet around noon can mean any time close to 12:00 PM, like 11:45 AM or 12:15 PM. It's commonly used to give a general idea of timing without being too specific.
