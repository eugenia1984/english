# DIALOGUE 1

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Notice

You use the verb ``notice`` to express that something got your attention. For example: ``Every time I see you, I notice that you are getting taller!``

In this dialogue, Maria sees a camera on Bob's desk and asks him about his interest in photography. To express that she saw the camera, she uses the verb notice in the past.

In Bob's sentence, you see a different structure being introduced. Instead of saying`` I am passionate about photography``, Bob uses ``I've been passionate about photography``. This has to do with the expression that comes right after, ``for many year``s.

When you see **'ve been** in a sentence, remember it is a contraction of the **verb have**, which becomes **'ve**, and the **verb to be in the participle form**.

For example: ``I've been in love with Jane for a long time now, but she just likes me as a friend.``
