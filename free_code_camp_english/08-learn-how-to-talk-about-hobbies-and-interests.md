# DIALOGUE 1

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Notice

You use the verb ``notice`` to express that something got your attention. For example: ``Every time I see you, I notice that you are getting taller!``

In this dialogue, Maria sees a camera on Bob's desk and asks him about his interest in photography. To express that she saw the camera, she uses the verb notice in the past.

##  <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/>  I've been

In Bob's sentence, you see a different structure being introduced. Instead of saying`` I am passionate about photography``, Bob uses ``I've been passionate about photography``. This has to do with the expression that comes right after, ``for many year``s.

When you see **'ve been** in a sentence, remember it is a contraction of the **verb have**, which becomes **'ve**, and the **verb to be in the participle form**.

For example: ``I've been in love with Jane for a long time now, but she just likes me as a friend.``

## Present Perfect Tense

The Present Perfect Tense is formed **using the auxiliary verb have or has with the past participle of a verb**. It's used **to talk about actions or situations from the past that still matter now**.

To form it, use: ``have`` + ``I / you / we / they / and`` or ``has`` with ``he / she / it`` + ``the past participle``.

For regular verbs, it's usually the verb plus -ed (like walked), but for irregular verbs, it can vary (like seen from see). For example:

``I have walked to the park or She has seen the movi``. This tense is helpful in discussing past actions with current relevance.

- In the Present Perfect Tense, you can contract have to **'ve** after I, you, we or they, and has to **'s** after he, she or it.

For example: ``I've walked to the park.`` or ``She's seen the movie.``

- The Present Perfect Tense is used to express past experiences that influence the present.

- In situations where the Present Perfect tense is used to express the duration of time of a certain action, you normally use **for** to refer to this duration. For example: ``I've been an architect for more than 15 years``. -> Your career in architecture began more than 15 years ago. In the phrase ``for nearly a decade now``, Bob is saying that his interest in photography started around a decade ago.

**Near** means close in distance or time, while **nearly** is used to indicate that something is almost, but not completely finished.

For example, if you're near finishing a project, you're close to completing it. If you've nearly finished, you're almost done but not quite there yet.

Have taken shows you did something before. Here's how you might use it:

Picking up: I have taken the book. - You took the book from somewhere.

Choosing: I have taken the red one. - You picked out the red one for yourself.

Accepting: I have taken your idea. - You decided to go with someone's idea.

Feeling: I have taken the joke seriously. - You thought the joke was more serious than it was meant to be.

# DIALOGUE 2

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Present Perfect Tense: since

The Present Perfect Tense can be used with the word **since** to discuss the starting point of ongoing actions or conditions. For instance, ``I have liked painting since I was a child``. implies that the speaker began to enjoy painting in their childhood and continues to do so. 

Note: the auxiliary verb have can be contracted to 've.

### Question form

Remember, to form questions in the Present Perfect Tense, the sentence structure must be rearranged by changing the position of the subject and the auxiliary verb have. The verb in its participle form (in this case, been) is places after the subject. 

For example: ``How long have you been a doctor?``

### For and since

In the Present Perfect Tense, **for** and **since** are used to discuss time duration and starting points. 

- **For tells how long something has been happening**.

- **Since tells when something started**.

### Negative form

In the Present Perfect Tense, to form a negative sentence, **you insert not directly after have or has**. This construction allows you to express actions and events that have not taken place recently.

For example, if Jake wishes to express that a significant amount of time has passed since his last bicycle ride, he could say, ``I have not been on a bike since I was a child``.

In this sentence, the combination of the verb have and not can also be abbreviated to **haven't**: ``I haven't been on a bike since I was a child.``

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/>  Would you like to...?

The phrase **Would you like to** is often used **when proposing or suggesting an activity**. 

When Linda says Would you like to go cycling with me one of these days?, it's similar to saying Hey, let's go cycling together.

The phrase would you like** is a polite way to offer something or ask someone if they want something**. When offering something, you can specify it directly after the expression would you like. For instance, you might ask ``Would you like some coffee?`` when offering coffee to a guest. 

If you are proposing to do something, such as going shopping, remember to include to between the expression and the action. For example:`` Would you like to go shopping?``. 

Finally, if you are asking someone if you should do something for them, use me between would you like and to. For example: ``Would you like me to make some coffee?``.

# DIALOGUE 3

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> That

When you talk about objects or things in a specific place, you often use the word **that** to point them out. For example, ``that shelf`` means the shelf you are talking about or focusing on at the moment.

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Shelf / Shelves

The word **shelf** is a noun that refers to a flat, horizontal surface used for holding items. 

When you talk about more than one shelf, you should change the ending to make it plural by replacing f with ves, so it becomes **shelves**. For example, one shelf, two shelves.
