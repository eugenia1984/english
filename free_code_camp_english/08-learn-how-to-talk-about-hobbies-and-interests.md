# DIALOGUE 1

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Notice

You use the verb ``notice`` to express that something got your attention. For example: ``Every time I see you, I notice that you are getting taller!``

In this dialogue, Maria sees a camera on Bob's desk and asks him about his interest in photography. To express that she saw the camera, she uses the verb notice in the past.

In Bob's sentence, you see a different structure being introduced. Instead of saying`` I am passionate about photography``, Bob uses ``I've been passionate about photography``. This has to do with the expression that comes right after, ``for many year``s.

When you see **'ve been** in a sentence, remember it is a contraction of the **verb have**, which becomes **'ve**, and the **verb to be in the participle form**.

For example: ``I've been in love with Jane for a long time now, but she just likes me as a friend.``

## Present Perfect Tense

The Present Perfect Tense is formed **using the auxiliary verb have or has with the past participle of a verb**. It's used **to talk about actions or situations from the past that still matter now**.

To form it, use: ``have`` + ``I / you / we / they / and`` or ``has`` with ``he / she / it`` + ``the past participle``.

For regular verbs, it's usually the verb plus -ed (like walked), but for irregular verbs, it can vary (like seen from see). For example:

``I have walked to the park or She has seen the movi``. This tense is helpful in discussing past actions with current relevance.

- In the Present Perfect Tense, you can contract have to **'ve** after I, you, we or they, and has to **'s** after he, she or it.

For example: ``I've walked to the park.`` or ``She's seen the movie.``
