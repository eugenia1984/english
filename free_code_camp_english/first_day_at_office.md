In English, many professions are named by adding **er** to the end of a word that describes what the person does.

For example, a `programmer` is someone who *programs*, a` developer` is someone who *develops* software or systems. Another example is a `designer`, who is a person that *designs* websites, graphics, or products.

**By adding er to a verb, you create a noun that describes a person's job**. It doesn't apply to all professions but you'll see this pattern in many.
