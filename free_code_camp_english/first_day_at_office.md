In English, many professions are named by adding **er** to the end of a word that describes what the person does.

For example, a `programmer` is someone who *programs*, a` developer` is someone who *develops* software or systems. Another example is a `designer`, who is a person that *designs* websites, graphics, or products.

**By adding er to a verb, you create a noun that describes a person's job**. It doesn't apply to all professions but you'll see this pattern in many.

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> He's as short of: He is or He has

**He's** can be a short form for **he ha**s or **he is**. You can understand which one it is by looking at the context. When he's is followed by a verb in the past participle (like been, done, seen), it means he has. For example: `He's been working means he has been working.`

If he's is followed by an adjective or a present participle (like tired, going, sleeping), it means he is. For example: `He's tired means he is tired.` Understanding this helps you know exactly what someone means when they say he's.

`UX` stands for User Experience, and `UI` stands for User Interface. A `UX/UI designer` works on designing websites or applications to make them easy and pleasant to use.
