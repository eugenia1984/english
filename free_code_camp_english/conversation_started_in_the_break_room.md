###  <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> VERB TO BE

In English, you can use the **verb to be** to ask questions about feelings, states, or conditions. When you want to ask such questions, you just swap the positions of the subject (like **you** or **he**) and the verb to be (like **are** or **is**). For example, to turn this sentence `You are a developer`. into a question, you switch you and are: `Are you a developer?` Notice how the order changes to ask a question.

Here are some more examples of turning statements into questions using to be: `He is here.` -> `Is he here?` | `They are ready`. -> `Are they ready?`

The suffix **-ly** can be added to words to indicate the frequency of an event. Here's how it applies to different time periods:

`Daily` -> means it occurs once every day.

`Weekly` -> indicates something that happens once every week.

`Monthly` -> describes something that happens once every month.

`Yearly (or annually)` ->  describes something that happens once every year.

The present perfect is **a tense used to indicate a link between the present and the past**. The time of the action is before now but not specified, and the person using it is usually more interested in the result than in the action itself. For example:

`I played this game yesterday.` - This is in the simple past tense. It states that the action of playing the game happened at a specific time in the past, which is yesterday.

`I have played this game before.` - This is in the present perfect tense. It states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.

`I’ve played this game before.` - This sentence is also in the present perfect tense, using the contraction I've for I have. Like the previous example, it states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.

So far you have learned how to create questions with the `verb to be`. In sentences with the verb to be (**am**, **is**, **are**) you just have to change the order of the noun and the verb to create a question. Like this: `You are a developer` -> `Are you a developer?`

Changing the order of the noun and the verb doesn’t work in every situation. Most sentences need you to add an auxiliary verb to create questions. One of the most common auxiliary verbs is **Do**.

You can use the verb do as an auxiliary to most verbs. In the present tense it assumes the form of **do (I, you, we, they)** and **does(he, she, it)**. It is like a marker you will add to the beginning of your sentence and lets everyone know that sentence is a question. For example: `Statement: You debug on Fridays. Question: Do you debug on Fridays?`
