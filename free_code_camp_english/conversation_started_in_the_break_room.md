In English, you can use the **verb to be** to ask questions about feelings, states, or conditions. When you want to ask such questions, you just swap the positions of the subject (like **you** or **he**) and the verb to be (like **are** or **is**). For example, to turn this sentence `You are a developer`. into a question, you switch you and are: `Are you a developer?` Notice how the order changes to ask a question.

Here are some more examples of turning statements into questions using to be: `He is here.` -> `Is he here?` | `They are ready`. -> `Are they ready?`
