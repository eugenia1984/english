# DIALOGUE 1

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> VERB TO BE

In English, you can use the **verb to be** to ask questions about feelings, states, or conditions. When you want to ask such questions, you just swap the positions of the subject (like **you** or **he**) and the verb to be (like **are** or **is**). For example, to turn this sentence `You are a developer`. into a question, you switch you and are: `Are you a developer?` Notice how the order changes to ask a question.

Here are some more examples of turning statements into questions using to be: `He is here.` -> `Is he here?` | `They are ready`. -> `Are they ready?`

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> SUFFIX -LY

The suffix **-ly** can be added to words to indicate the frequency of an event. Here's how it applies to different time periods:

`Daily` -> means it occurs once every day.

`Weekly` -> indicates something that happens once every week.

`Monthly` -> describes something that happens once every month.

`Yearly (or annually)` -> describes something that happens once every year.

The present perfect is **a tense used to indicate a link between the present and the past**. The time of the action is before now but not specified, and the person using it is usually more interested in the result than in the action itself. For example:

`I played this game yesterday.` - This is in the simple past tense. It states that the action of playing the game happened at a specific time in the past, which is yesterday.

`I have played this game before.` - This is in the present perfect tense. It states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.

`I’ve played this game before.` - This sentence is also in the present perfect tense, using the contraction I've for I have. Like the previous example, it states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.

# DIALOGUE 2

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Yes... but

- In a conversation, when you agree with someone but want to add more information, you can use `Yes... but` to continue your point. Example: **Yes**, I love it **but** I'm only practising.

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Questions with Do / Does

So far you have learned how to create questions with the `verb to be`. In sentences with the verb to be (**am**, **is**, **are**) you just have to change the order of the noun and the verb to create a question. Like this: `You are a developer` -> `Are you a developer?`

Changing the order of the noun and the verb doesn’t work in every situation. Most sentences need you to add an auxiliary verb to create questions. One of the most common auxiliary verbs is **Do**.

You can use the verb do as an auxiliary to most verbs. In the present tense it assumes the form of **do (I, you, we, they)** and **does(he, she, it)**. It is like a marker you will add to the beginning of your sentence and lets everyone know that sentence is a question. For example: `Statement: You debug on Fridays. Question: Do you debug on Fridays?`

```
- Statement: She works as a Full Stack dev.
- Question: Does she work as a Full Stack dev?
```

-> `work` stays as `work` and does not change to `works`, even when asking about a third person singular subject like he, she, or it.

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Negative with don't or doesn't

You can also use the auxiliary verb to in negative sentences. In negative sentences you combine the **auxiliary verb do (I, you, we, they)** or **does (he, she it)** with the word not and place it right before the main verb:

`I do not work everyday` - (Subject + do + not + main verb)

`It does not function` - (Subject + does + not + main verb)

```
- Affirmative: I do work on weekends. (means the person works on weekends)
- Negative: I don't work on weekends. (means the person does not work on weekends)
```

Often, to be more practical it is common to abbreviate do not and does not to don’t and doesn’t.

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Verbs with -S or -ES for he, she and it

In English, some verbs are conjugated. This means they change the form according to the person you are talking about. For most verbs, when we talk about another person like he, she, or it, we add an -s or -es to the verb.

For example: If you talk about Tom and photography you can say: `Tom takes photographs`, not Tom take photographs. This is how you show in your sentence that the action is done by Tom in the present tense.

For negative sentences, you can use doesn't followed by the base form of the verb.You do not add `-s` or `-es`. because does is already conjugated (do+es).

For example, if `Tom doesn't do video recording as a hobby`, you can say, `He doesn't record videos..`

When elaborating questions about a **third person singular (he, she or it)** you might need to use the auxiliary verb **does**.

For example: If Alice is curious about Sophie's hobbies and wants to ask Tom, she can say, `Does Sophie like hiking?` The word **does** is used here because the subject is Sophie, a third person singular. **Does** is used to form questions in the present simple tense for he, she, or it,

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Want to

When you want to talk about what someone hopes to do in the future, you can use `want to` to express desire or intention. Remember that `want to` doesn't change even when talking about others.

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Condition: only if

The expression **only if** is used to set a condition for something to happen. It’s like saying this will happen if that happens. It's a way of making an agreement where one action depends on another.

For example: if your friend says, `I'll go out only if it doesn't rain`, it means they will go out but the weather must be good - no rain.

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Simple Present - verbs with -s or -es

When you speak about what another person does every day, like your friend or a teacher, and you use he, she, or it you will often need to conjugate the verb of your sentence.

As you already studied, For most verbs conjugation can be simple. You just add s or es to the end of the verb.

For example: `You talk` -> `He talks` / `They do` -> `It does`

# DIALOGUE 3

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Adverbs of frequency

There are some words you can use in your sentence to express how often something happens. They are called **adverbs of frequency**.

**Usually** is a word that suggests that something happens more often than not but is not constant. When usually is used with the verb to be, it is placed after the verb. Ex: `She is usually on time for meetings.`

With other verbs, usually comes before the main verb, for example: `He usually works late.`

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Do you...? Yes, I do / I do or No, I don't / I don't

In this dialogue, Sophie says she likes working with Maria, their team lead.

Tom asks: `Do you enjoy working with her?`. To say yes to a question that starts with do, you can say` Yes, I do` or simply `I do`. To say no, you can say `No, I don't` or `I don't`.

# DIALOGUE 4

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Frequency: every

## When you want to know how often something happens, you can use **every** followed by a time period like `day`, `week`, or `year`.

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Frequency of actions

In English, words like **sometimes**, **always**, and **never** are used to describe the frequency of an action.

- **Sometimes** is used when an action happens on certain occasions but not every time. For example, I sometimes have coffee for breakfast. It indicates possibility but not certainty.

- **Always** is used when an action happens every single time without fail. For instance, The sun always rises in the east. It shows a consistent or habitual action.

- **Never** means an action does not happen at any time. For example, She never eats meat, indicating a complete absence of the action.

- **Occasionally** means something happens now and then. It is not all the time, and not never, but somewhere in between. If you occasionally get a bug in your code, it means it happens sometimes, but not too often.

Take a look at these adverbs, and the frequency they usually represent.

| Adverb       | Frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Never        | 0%        |
| Rarely       | 5%        |
| Seldom       | 15%       |
| Occasionally | 30%       |
| Sometimes    | 50%       |
| Often        | 70%       |
| Generally    | 80%       |
| Usually      | 90%       |
| Always       | 100%      |

Remember, **occasionally** means something happens sometimes, but not regularly or often. It's less frequent than **sometimes** and more frequent than rarely.
