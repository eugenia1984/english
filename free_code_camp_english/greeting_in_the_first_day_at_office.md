# DIALOG 2

-> When greeting someone casually or for the first time, `Hi, there` is a friendly way to say hello. It's often used in informal situations or to greet someone you might not know very well.

-> Using the correct articles (**a**, **an**, **the**) is crucial in English. Here, Tom is introducing himself and specifying his role at the new place. `I'm the new graphic designer` or `I'm a Developer`. Using **a** or **an** before a title indicates that the role isn't unique and there might be others with the same title.

-> **You're in luck** it expresses that someone is fortunate or has good luck in a situation

-> When someone says **too** at the end of a sentence, they mean also or as well

### Articles : a, an the

Identify how articles change the context of a sentence. Articles, like **the** and **a**, can change the meaning of a sentence.

- **The** talks about something specific.

- **A** talks about something in general.

The articles **a** and **an** are both used to indicate a singular, non-specific noun. The choice between them depends on the sound that follows. If the next word begins with a consonant sound, we use **a**. If it starts with a vowel sound, we use **an**. -> n English, a and an are indefinite articles. A is used before words that begin with a consonant sound, and an is used before words that begin with a vowel sound.

For Example: `Tom is a graphic designer in our company` means there are many graphic designers and Tom is one of them. `Tom is the graphic designer of our company` means there is only one person in the company matching this description (that's Tom).

Notice that, after `graphic designer`, there are details that made the situation more specific. In this company, there's only one person that could fit the profile - Tom.
