Tom: I'm from Texas? How about you?

```

-> When greeting someone casually or for the first time, `Hi, there` is a friendly way to say hello. It's often used in informal situations or to greet someone you might not know very well.


-> Using the correct articles (**a**, **an**, **the**) is crucial in English. Here, Tom is introducing himself and specifying his role at the new place. `I'm the new graphic designer` or `I'm a Developer`. Using **a** or **an** before a title indicates that the role isn't unique and there might be others with the same title.

-> **You're in luck** it expresses that someone is fortunate or has good luck in a situation

-> When someone says **too** at the end of a sentence, they mean also or as well


### Articles : a, an the

Identify how articles change the context of a sentence. Articles, like **the** and **a**, can change the meaning of a sentence. 

- **The** talks about something specific. 

- **A** talks about something in general.

For Example: `Tom is a graphic designer in our company` means there are many graphic designers and Tom is one of them. `Tom is the graphic designer of our company` means there is only one person in the company matching this description (that's Tom).

Notice that, after `graphic designer`, there are details that made the situation more specific. In this company, there's only one person that could fit the profile - Tom.

When you want to know about someone's origin or the place they grew up, you can ask `Where are you from?`. This question is a common way to know more about a person's background.

`I'm from...` is a standard way to indicate where someone is originally from, be it a city, country, or any other place of origin.

When someone asks you about your origin or where you are from, you can mention a specific place. If you are currently in the same location or state you're from, you can use `here` to indicate your current location or place.

The demonstrative pronoun **those** refers to plural nouns that are further away from the speaker in terms of distance or not currently being handled or discussed.
