Set one alarm and get up when it rings.

Breakfast give you the energy to start the day.

Have a balanced breakfast instead.

 Do you haeve any other suggestions?
- Expert: Yes, don't start your day by checking your phone or emails immediately
It creates stress and makes you feel like you have to rush.
Take a few minutes for yourself.
For example, you can stretch or do some breathing exercises to clear your mind.
- Sophie: That's a good idea.
- Expert: One more thing: don't rush during your morning routine.
Give yourself time to get ready without running around.
If you start the day feeling relaxed, you may have a more productive day.
- Sophie: Wow, thanks! I'll try to include these changes into my morning routine.
- Expert: You're welcome! And remember: the small changes make a big difference.
Your morning starts well when you have a good night's sleep.
Don't forget to get enough sleep to feel well-rested in the morning.
Have a great morning!

Yeah, I joined the team a few months ago.
I didn't study computer science at university,

about problem-solving and critical thinking.
- Brian: That's interesting!
So, you didn't work on many programming projects
during your studies, did you?
- Sophie: No, not really.

circuits designs and electric systems.
It was a bit different.

Did you enjoy your time there
even if it wasn't enterely tech-focussed?
- Sophie: I did.
It was challenging, but I met some fantastic people.
We have a bunch of marathons,

My plan was to become a therapist or counselor.
But during my last year, I took a course in organizational psychology,
and it piqued my interest in the workplace and employee dynamics.

Did you immediately start working as a tech recruiter after college?
- Anna: Not right away.
I worked in a general HR role at a non-tech company first,
focusing on training and development.

and care for the employees' well-being.
This is directly related to what made me want
