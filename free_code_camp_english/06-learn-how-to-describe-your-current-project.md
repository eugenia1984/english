# DIALOGUE 1

## <img width="48" height="48" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/48/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Preposition FOR

The preposition for is often used to explain the reason why we do something. Notice how for is followed by the reason or purpose of the action:

``I'm studying English for my job`` - for my job explains the reason for studying English.

``I go to the gym for my health`` - it means they go to the gym to stay healthy.

The word **might** is used to express possibility or uncertainty. It's similar to **may** but often implies a lower probability. For example:

``I might go to the park`` It means there's a possibility of going to the park, but it's not certain.

In James's sentence, might suggests that there are possible problems he's looking for, but he's not sure yet.
