# DIALOGUE 1

##  <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Adjectives

**Adjectives** are **words that describe or give more information about nouns or pronouns**. For example, in the phrase ``the blue sky``, ``blue`` is an adjective describing the sky.

Notice how **the adjective comes before the noun**. It is blue sky not sky blue.

Expressive language can include idiomatic expressions or descriptive adjectives to communicate strong feelings or vivid ideas, like saying ``sparkling eyes`` to describe someone's bright, lively eyes.

Instead of saying ``It seems like you have a ton of energy this morning``, James could say something like ``You look energetic this morning to convey the same idea``. ``Energetic`` is the adjective to represent someone who has a lot of energy.

Here are some more examples:

``She wakes up early every day`` - **Early** describes the time of her waking up. 

``He has a quick shower in the morning`` - **Quick** describes the short duration of the shower.
