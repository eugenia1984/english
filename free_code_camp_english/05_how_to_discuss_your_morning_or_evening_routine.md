# DIALOGUE 1

##  <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Adjectives

**Adjectives** are **words that describe or give more information about nouns or pronouns**. For example, in the phrase ``the blue sky``, ``blue`` is an adjective describing the sky.

Notice how **the adjective comes before the noun**. It is blue sky not sky blue.

Expressive language can include idiomatic expressions or descriptive adjectives to communicate strong feelings or vivid ideas, like saying ``sparkling eyes`` to describe someone's bright, lively eyes.

Instead of saying ``It seems like you have a ton of energy this morning``, James could say something like ``You look energetic this morning to convey the same idea``. ``Energetic`` is the adjective to represent someone who has a lot of energy.

Here are some more examples:

``She wakes up early every day`` - **Early** describes the time of her waking up. 

``He has a quick shower in the morning`` - **Quick** describes the short duration of the shower.

###  <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Idiomatic expressions

Idiomatic expressions are **phrases where the words together have a different meaning than the individual words might suggest**.

``A ton of energy`` is an idiomatic expression meaning having a lot of energy, similar to saying loads of energy.

Another expression would be I slept ``like a rock``, which means sleeping very deeply. Here are some more examples of Idiomatic Expressions:

She's ``feeling blue`` today. (feeling sad) 

This math problem ``is a piece of cake``. (very easy) 

``He's in hot water`` now. (in trouble) 

``They see eye to eye``. (agree with each other)

---

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Ordinary / out fo the ordinary

**Ordinary** means normal or usual. Something ordinary is not special or different. For example: ``Eating cereal for breakfast is ordinary``

**Out of the ordinary** means something unusual or not common. For example, ``if your friend usually takes the bus to school but one day arrives in a limousine, that's out of the ordinary``. It's not common or usual for them.

---


## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/>  Before / After

The words ``before`` and ``after`` are used to describe the order of events in time.

``Before`` is used to talk about something that happens earlier than another event, and ``after`` is used for something that happens later. For example:

``I brush my teeth before I have breakfast`` -> Brushing teeth happens first

``I go to work after I have breakfast`` -> Going to work happens later

---

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/>  Verb take with nouns

The verb ``take`` is used in many common English expressions. When take is used with different nouns, it can have special meanings. For example:

``Take a shower`` means to shower. 

``Take a walk`` means to go for a walk. 

``Take a nap`` means to sleep for a little while. 

``Take a chance`` means to try something that might be risky.

These phrases are like fixed recipes in English; the words go together to mean something specific.

---

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Balanced

The word **balanced** can be an **adjective** or the **past tense of the verb balance**. 

- As an adjective, it describes something that is in a state of equilibrium or evenly distributed, like in a ``balanced breakfast``.

- As a verb, balance (and its past tense balanced) means to keep or put something in a steady position so that it does not fall.

In a sentence, if balanced is used before a noun (like balanced diet), it's an adjective.

If it describes an action that happened in the past (like She balanced the books), it's a verb.

---

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Early / Late

- **Early** refers to doing something sooner or before the usual time, like waking up early in the morning.

- **Late** means doing something after the expected or usual time, like arriving late to a meeting. Here are some examples:

``She likes to start her day early with a jog. He often works late at the office``.

---

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/>  Never

The word never is **an adverb** used to mean **not at any time or not ever**. It's often used to talk about things that someone doesn't do or hasn't done. 

For example: ``I have never been to Australia``. (this means the person has not visited Australia at any time) ``She never eats fast`` food. (this means she does not eat fast food at any time)

---

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Thought

The word thought is the past tense of think. Thought of that means **to have considered or come up with an idea in the past**. For example: ``
I thought of going to the beach, but it was too cold``. (this means the person considered going to the beach)

---

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Gerund (-ing)

When a verb follows a preposition, it often takes the **-ing** form, known as a gerund. 

**Gerunds are verbs acting as nouns**. 

This rule is common in many English expressions. For example:

``After eating dinner, we watched a movie``. (eating follows the preposition after)

``She is interested in learning Spanish``. (learning follows the preposition in)

``Before going to bed, I like to read``. (going follows the preposition before)

---


### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Conditional with IF

The word **if** is often used in **conditional statements to talk about a possible situation and its consequences**. For example:

``If it rains, I will bring an umbrella``. (The action of bringing an umbrella depends on the possibility of rain.)

``If you need help, just ask``. (The offer to help is conditional on the other person needing it.)


`if + simple present / simple present`

`if + simple present / future with will`

Conditional sentences often use the word **if to describe a situation that will cause a particular result**. They typically consist of two parts: ``the condition (the if part) and the result``. For example: ``If you study hard, you will pass the exam`` -> condition: studying hard; result: passing the exam.

Conditional sentences often use if to describe a situation (cause) that will lead to a particular result (consequence). They typically consist of two parts: ``the if clause (condition) and the main clause (result)``. For example: ``If you sleep well, you will feel refreshed``. (condition: sleeping well; result: feeling refreshed)

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/>  Even

The word even is used** to add emphasis to a statement, often highlighting something surprising, unexpected, or extreme**.

When **combined with before** in the phrase even before, it **emphasizes that an action or event occurs earlier than usual or expected, adding a sense of surprise or admiration**. 

For example:

``Even before the sun rises, she starts her workout.``  -> emphasizes that her workout begins unusually early

``He finished the project even before the deadline.`` -> implies that finishing before the deadline is surprisingly early

In conversation, using even can express that something is more than what might be considered normal or usual. It makes the statement stronger.

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Future with WILL

You probably remember that I'll is the contracted form of I will, a modal verb used to express future intentions, decisions, or plans made at the moment of speaking. For example:

I'll call you tomorrow. (future intention to call) I'll take the bus to work. (decision made about taking the bus)

# DIALOGUE 2


## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Words end with "Y"

- Words ending in **y** often **describe a state or quality**. 

For example: If you add ``y`` to the noun ``sleep``, you create the adjective ``sleepy``, which means feeling a need to sleep or being tired. The y transforms the noun sleep into an adjective describing a condition. 

Similarly: 

``snow + y = snowy`` -> having a lot of snow

``rain + y = rainy`` -> having a lot of rain


- The y ending can also turn nouns into adjectives that describe a characteristic or quality.

``Healthy`` comes from the noun ``health`` and means having or showing good health. 

Like sleepy, the y changes the noun into an adjective. Other examples:

``Wealthy`` -> having a lot of wealth

``Cloudy`` -> full of or covered with clouds

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Maybe / May be

There's a difference between **may be** and **maybe**. Let's take a closer look.

- **May** on its own also **suggests possibility or permission**. **May be** suggests a **possibility or potentiality**.

- **Maybe** is an adverb **indicating uncertainty or possibility**. For example: ``It may be raining outside``, suggests a possibility of rain. ``Maybe I will go out later``, expresses uncertainty about going out. ``May I ask a question?``, asks for the permission to speak.

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Imperative: Do not / Don't

The imperative form is used **to give orders, instructions, or advice**. It often starts with a verb in the base form for positive commands, or with don't/do not for negative commands. Understanding this form is important for following or giving instructions. 

For example:

``Drink plenty of water`` -> positive command

``Don't stay up too late`` -> negative command

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/>  Later

**The word later is the comparative form of late**, used to indicate a time or event that is after the expected, usual, or planned time. Comparatives are used to compare two things. For example:

``We will leave later than planned``. -> means leaving after the planned time

``She arrived later than me``. -> indicates she arrived after the speaker

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Who

Who can be used as a relative pronoun to introduce a clause that gives more information about a person or people. It links a description or action specifically to a person. For example:

She is someone who always knows what to do. (links the knowing what to do to the person)

He's the data analyst who helped me a lot. (describes the data analyst with the action of helping)

# DIALOGUE 3


## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Past Tense

### IRREGULAR VERBS

Past tense verbs are used to talk about actions that happened in the past. Some verbs change their form in the past tense, like say to said. For example: ``Yesterday, she said she would join us`` (SAID -> Past tense of say) ``He said the meeting was at noon`` (SAID -> Describes a past statement about the meeting time)

Another example of irregular verb is tell, which becomes told in the past tense. For example: ``He told me about the plan last week`` (TELL -> Past tense of tell) ``Last night, they told stories about our last project`` (Using told to describe a past action)

### REGULAR VERBS

Regular verbs usually add **-ed** to form the past tense. This can also result in some adjectives as in the dialogue.

``Complicated`` is the past tense form of the regular verb ``complicate``, as well as the adjective that means something is not simple or easy to do. One example of it as a verb can be: ``The problems on the road complicated our trip.``

``I walked to the store`` -> WALK / WALKED ->Past tense of walk

``She cleaned her room yesterday`` -> CLEAN / CLEANED -> Past tense of clean


---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Could / Can

The modal verb **could** is often used to **politely ask for help or suggestions**. For example: ``Could you show me how to do this?`` (asking for help in a polite way) ``What could I do to improve my skills?`` (asking for suggestions)

Understanding how to use could is important to create polite requests or questions.

### Understanding the difference between can and could is crucial in English.

- **Can** is used to express ability, possibility, or to ask permission in the present or future. For example: ``I can code very well`` (present ability) ``Can I leave early today?`` (asking for permission)

- **Could** is often used for polite requests, suggestions, or to talk about ability in the past. For example: ``Could you pass me that tool, please?`` (polite request) ``When I first learned programming, I could spend hours debugging without getting tired ``(past ability)

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Adjectives

Adjectives usually come before the nouns they describe, and there's a specific order: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose. For example: A beautiful old Italian painting (opinion, age, origin)

In the phrase simple and quick meals, simple (describing ease) and quick (describing speed) are adjectives. The order is flexible because they belong to different categories (opinion and speed).

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Them / their

Let's review the usage of **them** and **their**. Them is used to refer to multiple people previously mentioned, and their shows possession or belonging to these people. For example: ``I saw the kids. I gave them their toys``. (them refers to the kids; their shows the toys belong to the kids)

---

## <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> While

While is used in sentences to indicate that two actions or events are happening at the same time. It often sets the scene for one action that occurs during the time another action is taking place. For example:

``While I cook, I listen to music`` (I listen to music at the same time as I am cooking)

``She reads while waiting for the bus`` (She reads during the time she is waiting)
