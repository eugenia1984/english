# DIALOGUE 1

##  <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Adjectives

**Adjectives** are **words that describe or give more information about nouns or pronouns**. For example, in the phrase ``the blue sky``, ``blue`` is an adjective describing the sky.

Notice how **the adjective comes before the noun**. It is blue sky not sky blue.

Expressive language can include idiomatic expressions or descriptive adjectives to communicate strong feelings or vivid ideas, like saying ``sparkling eyes`` to describe someone's bright, lively eyes.

Instead of saying ``It seems like you have a ton of energy this morning``, James could say something like ``You look energetic this morning to convey the same idea``. ``Energetic`` is the adjective to represent someone who has a lot of energy.

Here are some more examples:

``She wakes up early every day`` - **Early** describes the time of her waking up. 

``He has a quick shower in the morning`` - **Quick** describes the short duration of the shower.

Idiomatic expressions are **phrases where the words together have a different meaning than the individual words might suggest**.

``A ton of energy`` is an idiomatic expression meaning having a lot of energy, similar to saying loads of energy.

Another expression would be I slept ``like a rock``, which means sleeping very deeply. Here are some more examples of Idiomatic Expressions:

She's ``feeling blue`` today. (feeling sad) 

This math problem ``is a piece of cake``. (very easy) 

``He's in hot water`` now. (in trouble) 

``They see eye to eye``. (agree with each other)

**Ordinary** means normal or usual. Something ordinary is not special or different. For example: ``Eating cereal for breakfast is ordinary``

**Out of the ordinary** means something unusual or not common. For example, ``if your friend usually takes the bus to school but one day arrives in a limousine, that's out of the ordinary``. It's not common or usual for them.

The words ``before`` and ``after`` are used to describe the order of events in time.

``Before`` is used to talk about something that happens earlier than another event, and ``after`` is used for something that happens later. For example:

``I brush my teeth before I have breakfast`` -> Brushing teeth happens first

``I go to work after I have breakfast`` -> Going to work happens later

The verb ``take`` is used in many common English expressions. When take is used with different nouns, it can have special meanings. For example:

``Take a shower`` means to shower. 

``Take a walk`` means to go for a walk. 

``Take a nap`` means to sleep for a little while. 

``Take a chance`` means to try something that might be risky.

These phrases are like fixed recipes in English; the words go together to mean something specific.

### <img width="28" height="28" src="https://img.icons8.com/emoji/28/united-kingdom-emoji.png" alt="united-kingdom-emoji"/> Balanced

The word **balanced** can be an **adjective** or the **past tense of the verb balance**. 

- As an adjective, it describes something that is in a state of equilibrium or evenly distributed, like in a ``balanced breakfast``.

- As a verb, balance (and its past tense balanced) means to keep or put something in a steady position so that it does not fall.

In a sentence, if balanced is used before a noun (like balanced diet), it's an adjective.

If it describes an action that happened in the past (like She balanced the books), it's a verb.
