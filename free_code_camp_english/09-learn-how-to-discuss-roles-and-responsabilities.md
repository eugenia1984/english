## Present Perfect Tense

The Present Perfect Tense is formed with **have** or **has** plus **the past participle of a verb**. 

For example, for the irregular verb meet, its past participle is met. 

- **This tense is used to talk about experiences or actions from the past that still matter now**.

- Use **have** with the pronouns **I**, **you**, **we**, and **they**.

- Use **has** with **he**, **she**, and **it**.

The word **yet** is often used in questions in the Present Perfect Tense to inquire if something has happened up to now.
