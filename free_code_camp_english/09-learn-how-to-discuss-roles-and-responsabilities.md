## Present Perfect Tense

The Present Perfect Tense is formed with **have** or **has** plus **the past participle of a verb**. 

For example, for the irregular verb meet, its past participle is met. 

- **This tense is used to talk about experiences or actions from the past that still matter now**.

- Use **have** with the pronouns **I**, **you**, **we**, and **they**.

- Use **has** with **he**, **she**, and **it**.

The word **yet** is often used in questions in the Present Perfect Tense to inquire if something has happened up to now.

## Present Perfect Tense - Negative

The Present Perfect tense negative form is used to talk about things that have not happened at any time up until now. It's formed using **have not** or **has not** (**haven't/hasn't**) followed by **the past participle of the verb**.

For example: ``I haven't finished my homework yet``. or ``She hasn't called me back``.

##  in + someone's early/late + numbers

The structure in + someone's early/late + numbers is used to talk about a person's age without specifying exactly how old they are.

Examples:

``My brother is in his early 20``s. This gives a general idea that he is at the beginning of his twenties without specifying the exact age.

``My aunt is in her late 50s``. It suggests she is towards the end of her fifties, close to turning 60, but doesn't say the precise age.

## Describing

When you describe something with more than one adjective, there's a specific order. For example, for describing hair, the length (like long) usually comes before the color (like blond).

Example: `She is a tall woman in her early 40s, with LONG BLOND hair and glasses.`

- if there are more adjectives, you often start with **size or age**, then talk about **shape**, and finally **color**. For example, when talking about a balloon, you might say ``a big round red balloon``. Example: `A large square blue box`

### with

When describing someone's appearance, you often use with followed by a feature.

Examples:

``with glasses`` for someone who wears glasses

``with curly hair`` for someone who has curly hair, or

``with a blue jacket`` for someone wearing a blue jacket

## have/has been + verb-ing

The structure **have/has been + verb-ing** is used in the **Present Perfect Continuous** tense. It emphasizes** actions that started in the past and are still continuing now**. Been is the past participle form of the verb be.

It can be used with for followed by a period of time or since followed by a specific starting point in time to highlight the duration or how long the action happens.

Examples:

``We have been studying English for three years``. This means we started studying English three years ago and are still studying it now.

``He has been playing the guitar since he was ten``. This means he started playing the guitar when he was ten years old and continues to play it.
