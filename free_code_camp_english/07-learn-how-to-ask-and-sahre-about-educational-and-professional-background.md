English, the simple present tense is used to describe habitual or usual actions. However, when you are **talking about past roles or experiences, like in an interview**, you should use the simple past tense.

**The simple past tense often involves changing verbs**. For example, ``is`` becomes ``was`` for singular subjects and ``are`` becomes ``were`` for plural subjects.

For example, ``I am a teacher`` in the present becomes ``I was a teacher`` for past experiences. Similarly, ``They are engineers`` changes to ``They were engineers`` when speaking about the past.

### Questions

Questions in the past tense with the verb to be are very similar to how you do it in the present tense. The only difference is that you need to remember to conjugate the verb to were or was, followed by the subject and then the main verb. For example:

``Were you at the meeting yesterday?`` Notice how were comes before you to for a question. 

``What was my assignment?`` For a specific question, notice how was comes after what and before my.

The phrase could you tell me is a polite way to ask someone for information. It's commonly used in formal or professional situations, like job interviews or meetings. In English, some verbs have irregular past forms, meaning they do not follow the regular pattern of adding -ed to make the past tense. Can is one such verb, and its irregular simple past form is could.

The existence of irregular forms, like could, often comes from the way language has evolved over time. These forms do not follow the regular patterns and need to be memorized.

For example:

Present: I can speak English.

Past: I could speak English when I was six.

For most verbs, if you want to make a negative sentence in the past tense, simply put didn't in front of the main verb. Didn't is short for did not.

Remember that the main verb stays in its simple form. Only the auxiliary verb did is conjugated. For example:

- Affirmative sentence in the past: ``I worked yesterday`` - The Verb work is conjugated to the past.

- Negative sentence in the past: ``I didn't work yesterday`` - Only the auxiliary verb is conjugated to the past.

## Wasn't / weren't

There are some verbs you can't use didn't to create negative sentences in the past. The verb to beis one of them.

If you want to create a negative sentence using the verb to be in the past, simply add not after was or were. 

For example:

It was working normally -> ``It wasn't working normally``.

They were informed earlier -> ``They weren't informed earlier``.

Wasn't is the abbreviation of was not and weren't the abbreviation of were not.

When you want to ask someone about their experiences related to a past event, you can say ``Did you enjoy...?``. This is a simple way to ask about someone's preferences or satisfaction.

``Even if`` is used to introduce a condition or situation that contrasts with the main part of the question or statement. It helps to provide more context or specify conditions under which something occurred or was felt.

For example, ``Did you enjoy your vacation, even if it rained every day?`` adds a contrasting condition to the question about the vacation.

When answering to a past simple interrogative (a question), you can answer affirmatively with ``did`` or negatively with ``didn't``.

For example, ``Did you go to the party?`` can be answered with: ``I did`` (affirmative) or ``I didn't`` (negative).
