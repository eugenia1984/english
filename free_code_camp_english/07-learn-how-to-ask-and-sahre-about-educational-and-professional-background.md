English, the simple present tense is used to describe habitual or usual actions. However, when you are **talking about past roles or experiences, like in an interview**, you should use the simple past tense.

**The simple past tense often involves changing verbs**. For example, ``is`` becomes ``was`` for singular subjects and ``are`` becomes ``were`` for plural subjects.

For example, ``I am a teacher`` in the present becomes ``I was a teacher`` for past experiences. Similarly, ``They are engineers`` changes to ``They were engineers`` when speaking about the past.

### Questions

Questions in the past tense with the verb to be are very similar to how you do it in the present tense. The only difference is that you need to remember to conjugate the verb to were or was, followed by the subject and then the main verb. For example:

``Were you at the meeting yesterday?`` Notice how were comes before you to for a question. 

``What was my assignment?`` For a specific question, notice how was comes after what and before my.
