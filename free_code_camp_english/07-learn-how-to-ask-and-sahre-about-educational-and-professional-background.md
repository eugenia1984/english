English, the simple present tense is used to describe habitual or usual actions. However, when you are **talking about past roles or experiences, like in an interview**, you should use the simple past tense.

**The simple past tense often involves changing verbs**. For example, ``is`` becomes ``was`` for singular subjects and ``are`` becomes ``were`` for plural subjects.

For example, ``I am a teacher`` in the present becomes ``I was a teacher`` for past experiences. Similarly, ``They are engineers`` changes to ``They were engineers`` when speaking about the past.
