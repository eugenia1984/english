## :book: Current status - PRESENT CONTINUOUS

- **To talk about an action that is happening at the precise moment of speaking**. Ex: I'm doing the report for next week.

- **To talk about temporary situations**. Ex: I'm working with HR this week.

- **To mention actions that generally represent an ANNOYANCE**. Always to emphasis the idea. Ex: The secretary is **always** calling me when I'm in a meeting.

- **To refer to changing situations**, with verbs, like: **get**, **change**, **become**, **improve**, **begin** and **start**. Ex: Sales are **improving** very quickly.

### Affirmative structure with I

SUBJECT + TO BE + VERB IN THE -ING + (COMPLEMENT)

I - am - finishing - my reports now

I - am - having - an interview next week

### With other personal pronuns

SUBJECT + TO BE + VERB IN THE -ING + (COMPLEMENT)

He - is - fixing - the issue - right now

She - is - taking - some time to analized the proposal

They - 're - having a video conference - next Monday

We - 're - meeting with our client - in a month

-> **REMEBER**: to talk about your habits use PRESENT SIMPLE (fixed habits or routines) or PRESENT CONTINUOUS (actions happenings at the present moment)

## :book: What are you working on?

Use the PRESENT CONTINUOS or a FUTURE TENSE.

### Present continuous structure

**I + to be * gerund (verb + ing) + phrase**

### Correct preposition use

- Use **on**, not with. Ex: I'm working on the Backend. / I'm working on Java.

### How to respond and how not to respond

- Say `I'm reviewing Carla's wok`, instead of saying: Reviewing.

- Say: `I'm tracking glitches`, instead of saying: traking.

- Say: `I'm installing network operating system`, instead of saing: Installing stuff.

### Future tense examples

- I will be reviewing...

- I will be tracking...
 
- I will be installing ...

### TO + INFINITIVE Structure for a purpose

**subject + present continuous + phrase + to infinitive + phrase**

Ex: I'm coding with a "team member" **to enhance** the UX.

Ex: I'm sending emails to the client **to update** them about our progress.

### MORE TO + INFINITIVE OPTIONS

```
- To better  - To produce
- To make  - To show
- To fix - To improve
- To correct - To connect
```
