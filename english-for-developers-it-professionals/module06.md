## :book: Questions about impediments 

### Questions using the present simple

**Wh** or interrogative words. **what?**, **When?**, **Where?**, **Who?**, **Why?**, **How?**, **How often?**

Let's do a revision! -> Affirmative sentenses: SUBJECT + MAIN VERB + OBJECT + COMPLEMENTS. Ex: I work on the project in the evenings

- For questions, we need to make changes: **AUXILIARITY + SUBJECT + MAIN VERB + OBJECT + COMPLEMENTS**

Ex: Do - you - work - onthe project in the evenings?

- To ask specific information, form an information question: **WH WORD + AUXILIARY + SUBJECT + MAIN VERB + OBJECT + COMPLEMENTS**.

Ex1.: When - do - you - work - on the project?

Ex2.: What - does - she - do - on Saturdays?

Ex3.: Where - does - he - live?

## :book: Do you have any blocks or impediments

- Use: `I donÂ¡t have any`, instead of: I don't have none.

- Use: `At the moment, no`, instead of: Nope.

- Use: `For now, everything is on track`, instead of: Alright.

- Use: `All good for now`, instead of: Great.

- `I have a few`. `Unfortunatly, I do: ...`

### Isn't vs. Doesn't

`The VPN doesn't work` vs. `The VPN isn't working` (there is a problem with the VPn that need to be fix)

`This USB drive doesn't work` vs `This USB drive isn't working`(the USD drive is having an issue that needs fixing)

-> ISN'T can be fixed
